            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Preface to it. 2. The Hymne it ſelfe. In the Preface a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, there are two points obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. 1. The ſpeciall enabling of <hi>Zacharie</hi> to this buſineſſe. 2. The generall nature of the thing performed. The enabling of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> is in theſe words, <hi>He was filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>(the Holy Ghoſt)</hi> we muſt not heere vnderſtand the very Eſſence and Deity of the third perſon in Trinity, but the gifts and graces of the Holie Ghoſt, according as the word is often ſo taken in the Scripture <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 3.34. Ioh. 7 39. Rom. 8.9.</note>. By being <hi>filled with the Holy Ghost,</hi> we muſt not imagine, that <hi>Zacharie</hi> till this time was deſtitute of the graces of the ſpirit, but this is the meaning, that at this time, and vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a more large and plentifull meaſure of the graces of Gods ſpirit appeared in him. In this we may obſerue,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19491:4"/>
that <hi>Zacharie</hi> afflicted formerly with the dumbneſſe of many moneths, hath not onely the libertie of his ſpeech reſtored, but being endowed with a fuller portion of Gods graces, his toong is made the inſtrument of the Holie Ghoſt, in vttering a matter of extraordinarie conſequence. From whence wee may collect this doctrine:<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> That the comforts which GOD heapeth vpon his afflicted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants doe come in with a kinde of aduantage; there is not onely a remoouing of the affliction, but a beſtowing withall of ſome ſpeciall kindneſſe. <hi>Zacharie</hi> is not onely now not dumbe, but (which is more) is enabled by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie meaſure of ſpirituall gifts, euen in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner, to ſet foorth the whole myſterie of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind. Wee meet with like examples in holie writ. Great was the affliction of <hi>Ioſeph. He was ſold for a ſlaue, they held his feet in the ſtocks, and he was laid in yrons</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 105.17.18.</note>. But when the Lord had thorowly tried him, as ſiluer is tried, in the furnace of a long &amp; grieuous affliction, he was not barely enlarged, but withall aduanced to a place of great reſpect. <hi>The king made him Lord of his houſe, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">verſ. 21.</note>. <hi>Moſes</hi> his triall is at large ſet downe in the ſtorie <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 2.14. &amp;c.</note>, his feare, his flight, and his long ſeruice in Midian; but when Gods appointed time came, he not onely reſtored him to the fellowſhip of his owne countreymen, but made him the guide and captaine of his people, ſo that hee neuer wrought greater things by the hand of any meere man, than he did by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Notorious is the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of <hi>Iob,</hi> how he was tormented in perſon, and waſted in eſtate: but when <hi>the Lord turned his captiuitie, hee gaue him twice ſo much as he had before</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 42.10.</note>, <hi>and bleſſed his last daies more than the firſt</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">verſ. 12.</note>. To this agreeth that of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſaith, that the Lord did not onely <hi>bring him out of the horrible pit,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſet his feet vpon a rocke, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his goings</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0.2.</note>. And that of the afflicted people is of like nature; <hi>After two daies</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he will reuiue vs:</hi> that is not all, but, <hi>in the third day he will raiſe vs vp, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19491:4"/>
we ſhall liue in his ſight</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Hoſ. 6.2.</note>. He would not only pull backe his hand and forbeare to ſmite (which yet had beene much) but he would come as a skilfull and tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Surgeon, to lappe vp their ſores, to powre oyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their wounds; <hi>to giue them beautie for aſhes, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gladneſſe for the ſpirit of heauineſſe</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 61.3.</note>: neither would he alone in ſome little meaſure reuiue and quicken them, but he would giue that large meaſure of ſtrength that they ſhould <hi>liue in his ſight. They which went weeping,</hi> do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>returne with ioy,</hi> but they do ouer and aboue <hi>bring their ſheaues</hi> with them <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 126.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the Lords ſo dealing proceeds, firſt, from his mercie: <hi>He knoweth whereof we be made</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) he remembreth that wee are but dust</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 103.14.</note>: therefore leſt his afflicted ſeruants ſhould bee ſwallowed vp with heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and euen ouercome with diſcouragement, he doth not onely withdraw his hand of chaſtiſement, but, hee addeth ſome ſpeciall mercy, to the end that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be comfortablie aſſured, that whatſoeuer was done, was done to prepare them for a greater kindneſſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, it proceedeth from his Wiſedome: hee knoweth that none doe value his kindneſſes more, or are fitter to imploy them to their owne good and the good of others, than thoſe that haue beene moſt humbled by afflictions: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as no ground is ſo fit to receiue ſeed, euen with a full hand, as that which hath beene moſt torne with the plough, and beaten ſmalleſt with the labour of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman: For this cauſe God is wont to make readie his ſeruants for great graces by great croſſes: Affliction is his ſchoole in which hee traineth them vp for the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is full of comfort to all,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> who being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the croſſe in what kinde ſoeuer, doe looke vp to the hand which ſmiteth, and ſeeke to profit by tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lords yoke is vnpleaſing to fleſh and blood, and his chaſtiſements like bitter pilles which cannot goe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19491:5"/>
downe without much annoyance to the ſtomacke; but if thou wilt haue true ſolide comfort, looke not ſo much vpon the preſent grieuance, as vpon the <hi>quiet fruit of Righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Hebr. 12.11.</note> which will ſurely follow: and take it for a rule which neuer faileth, that the croſſe (if care bee had to profit thereby) neuer departs but it leaueth a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing behinde: God giues ſome ſpeciall fauour or other in lieu of the former burthen. <hi>Zacharie,</hi> who had beene dumbe ten moneths, not only ſpeakes, but being furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a large portion of new grace, he ſpeaks more heauenly than before. Learne thus to bee humbled with <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and ſo, thus thou ſhalt be comforted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>Secondly, from hence we are taught another doctrine; <hi>That thoſe whom God intendeth to imploy in any ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, hee furniſheth with gifts ſuteable to the nature of the buſineſſe, in which he will employ them. Zacharie</hi> is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prophecie: the buſineſſe is waightie, therefore he is <hi>filled with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that he may be able to performe it. This may be made plaine by many particulars: The Lord meant to ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> vpon a ſeruice of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. <hi>I will ſend thee to Pharaoh &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 3.10.</note>: <hi>Moſes,</hi> being guiltie of his owne infirmitie, was afraid to vndergoe it: <hi>Oh my Lord I am not eloquent &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 4.10.</note>: The Lord ſupplied his want: <hi>Goe now, and I will be with thy mouth, &amp;c</hi>

               <note n="q" place="margin">Iſay 6.5.</note>. After this one of the Seraphims touched his mouth with a coale from the Altar, and the Prophet was thereupon ſo ſenſible of the ſupplie of grace, that hee was as ready to go as the Lord was to imploie him: <hi>Heere am I, ſend me</hi>

It were an odious imputation to the wiſeſt God, to thinke him leſſe carefull in his buſineſſe, than men are in their affaires.

               <note n="i" place="margin">Matt. 7.16.</note>, ſo the heart of man, which is in itſelfe, euen a verie mint of vanitie, and a forge of profane, godleſſe and irreligious thoughts, cannot bring foorth any good matter without ſpeciall enabling.</p>
            <p>This is a good admonition to all thoſe which intend to enter into any ſeruice of weight,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> either in the Church or commonwealth. It is a dangerous thing to thruſt ones ſelfe into the Lords buſineſſe. Heauie will that ſaying be, when God ſhall ſay of any; <hi>I haue not ſent them, yet they ranne</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19491:6"/>
whether God hath ſent him, muſt not ſtay for reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or ſome ſpeciall informations from heauen, but hee muſt ſearch his owne heart, to ſee with what graces he furniſhed: If betweene the calling he intends, and his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, there be any proportion, there is an euidence of ſending; where there is not, he that vndertakes it, is but an intruder, and his reckening will be terrible.</p>
            <p>Now followeth to conſider the generall nature of the buſineſſe to which <hi>Zacharie</hi> was enabled: It is ſaid, <hi>hee Prophecied.</hi> To <hi>Prophecie,</hi> in Scripture ſignifieth two things: 1. To foretell things to come, and ſo the word ordinarily ſignifieth in the old Teſtament. 2. Exactly and ſoundly to interpret the Scripture, to which ſenſe the word is often applied in the new Teſtament <note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.1. &amp;c. 1. Theſſ. 5.20.</note>. <hi>Zacharie</hi> his <hi>Prophecying</hi> may not vnfitly be referred to both: For he partly foretold things to come, as of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and partly alſo hee did excellently interpret things anciently written of the Meſſias. Once, this we ſee, that the Holie Ghoſt in him was not idle, but did diſcouer it ſelfe in ſome holy and religious imployment: ſo that hence this is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That the graces of Gods ſpirit whereſoeuer they bee, are not idle, but are alwaies to be ſeene in the doing of ſome ſpirituall good, according to their places and callings who are indued therewith. Zacharie</hi> is <hi>filled with the Holy Ghost,</hi> and ſtraightway he prophecieth: the more graces hee had receiued in himſelfe, the more good proceedeth from him to others. <hi>He that beleeueth on me,</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>out of his bellie ſhall flow riuers of life</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 7.38.</note>. The graces receiued ſhall iſſue out to the refreſhing of others. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>it pleaſed God to reueale his Sonne to him, that he might preach him among the Gentiles</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note>, and that <hi>God did comfort him in all his tribulation, that he might be able to comfort others</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 1.4.</note>. It is an expreſſe commandement: <hi>Euerie man as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued;</hi>
               <note place="margin">6</note> 
               <hi>ſo let him miniſter vnto another, as a good diſpoſer of the manifold grace of God</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Pet. 4.10.</note>. Euery one is a Steward, not to engroſſe Gods graces to himſelfe, but to imploy them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19491:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to a common benefit. <hi>The word</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut vp in my bones, and I could not ſtay</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ier 20.9.</note>: and, <hi>we cannot but ſpeake,</hi> ſay the Apoſtles <note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 4.20.</note>. The gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit are like the ointment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Marie</hi> anointed Ieſus feete; the text ſaith, <hi>the houſe was filled with the ſauour of it</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Iob. 12 3.</note>. It is truely ſaid, that Good is a ſpreader of it ſelfe <note n="u" place="margin">Bonumeſt ſui diffuſium.</note>: It is like a candle in a workmans ſhop in a winters euening, which both giueth light to the workman, and to the paſſers by alſo.</p>
            <p>This firſt may be an aduertiſement to thoſe,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to the ſeruice of the Church, are negligent in their places: ſome ſuch would bee accounted learned and good ſcholars. But it cannot be ſo: Where the graces of God are, they are neuer idle: Where there is idleneſſe in action, there is emptineſſe in affection. It may be that in ſuch a loiterer, as the Prophet ſpeaketh of, <hi>who lieth &amp; ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and delights in ſleeping</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Iſa. 56.10.</note>, there may be a great deale of confuſed knowledge, but certainly there is no ſanctified learning: There is no Holie Ghoſt in thy heart, if (thy calling requiring it) there be no Prophecy in thy mouth; and what vſe is there of a head full of learning, with a mouthfull of nothing? It is truely ſaid that the <hi>Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue knowledge</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note>: But why? To hoord it vp as miſers do their come? No: But that his lips may <hi>feed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Pro. 10.21.</note>, and may <hi>ſpread abroad knowledge</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 15.7.</note>. Therefore alſo (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the people muſt ſeeke it at his mouth</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 2.7.</note>. Wherfore let vs hold this: The gifts of the ſpirit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable imployment cannot be ſeparated; He is not truely learned, who doth not truely labour: <hi>When thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted ſtrengthen the brethren</hi>

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may haue a larger application to all; thus, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note>: Now if wee would know whether Chriſts ſpirit be in vs or no, we muſt follow Chriſts rule, of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the tree by the fruits <note n="e" place="margin">Matt 7.16.</note>. Let vs ſee what comes from vs, which may be profitable to others in matters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

life eternall. Where be thoſe particulars ſpoken of in the Scripture, <hi>admoniſhing the vnruly, comforting the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded, &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.14.</note>. Where is our <hi>Conſidering one another to prouoke to loue and to good workes</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. 10.24.</note>? Where be our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, exhortations and inſtructions in our families? Where ſuch fruits as theſe bee are wanting, there the graces of Gods ſpirit are not preſent. Hee that is not carefull in his place to profit others in the waies of godlineſſe, himſelfe is farre from any true taſte of godlineſſe. <hi>Zacharie</hi> was <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and he was foorthwith imployed in a ſpirituall ſeruice, of which euen we haue the benefit to this day. Thus much of the Preface.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The diuiſion of the Hymn into <hi>2.</hi> parts.</note>The Prophecie or Hymne it ſelfe may be diuided into two parts: the firſt of which is touching Chriſt and the worke of ſaluation by him wrought, vnto the 76. verſe: the ſecond is of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and his office in reſpect of Chriſt.<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> part diuided.</note> The former part againe may be cut into two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: 1. A propoſition <hi>(Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael.)</hi> 2. The proofe thereof <hi>(For he hath viſited and redeemed his people &amp;c.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the propoſition we haue to note two things. 1. A du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie performed: 2. A deſcription of the partie to whom it is performed. The dutie performed, is a <hi>Bleſſing of God.</hi> To <hi>Bleſſe God,</hi> is an ordinarie phraſe of Scripture, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth nothing elſe, but to giue thanks to God for his bleſſings receiued: Theſe words, <hi>praiſe God,</hi> or <hi>bleſſe God,</hi> or <hi>giue thanks to God,</hi> are indifferently tranſlated: It is all one as if <hi>Zacharie</hi> had ſaid, <hi>All praiſe, honour and thanke be giuen vnto God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> The Doctrine commended to vs is this; <hi>That the praiſing and bleſſing of the name of God for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is one part of that ſpirituall worſhip and ſeruice, which is owing from vs vnto God.</hi> It is plaine by the text. For I aske what that was which <hi>Zacharie</hi> heere performed: It muſt be anſwered, that he offered vp a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing vnto God. I aske againe, Did he therein worſhip God? Out of all queſtion he did, and that which he did, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19491:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the ſpirit of God, and could not chuſe but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before him. Out of theſe it muſt needs follow, that thankeſgiuing is one part of that dutie which is to bee performed by vs vnto God. This will eaſily be made good by Scripture: <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in the day of trouble, ſo I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note>. <hi>Let vs offer the ſacrifice of praier alwaies to God</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Hebr. 13.15.</note>. This kinde of ſeruice is in thoſe words compared to thoſe ſweet ſmelling ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which in the time of the Law were offered to God. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>ioyne giuing of thanks with our requeſts which wee ſhew vnto God</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 4.6.</note>: ſo that this dutie is like the ſalt with which all our ſeruices muſt bee ſeaſoned. Hence are the commendations giuen of it, <hi>It becommeth vpright men to be thankefull</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 33.1.</note>: <hi>It is a good thing to praiſe the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 92.1.</note>: <hi>It is a pleaſant thing, and praiſe is comely</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 147.1.</note>. Hence was <hi>Dauids</hi> care to giue euidence of ſpeciall thankfulneſſe vpon ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: from whence came that phraſe of his, <hi>A new ſong</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 40.3.</note>, ſignifying his courſe of particular inſiſting vpon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fauours. The default heerein remaineth as a great ſtaine in the good name of <hi>Hezekiah, He did not render according to the reward beſtowed vpon him</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Chr. 32.25. <hi>The Vſe.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>This ſhould prouoke vs to make conſcience of this duty, euerie man ſaying to his ſoule with <hi>Dauid, My ſoule prayſe thou the Lord, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 103.1.</note>. Thankeſgiuing was ordained as an exerciſe for man in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and ſhall be an exerciſe in heauen, when as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſes are determined. In heauen the word and Sacraments ſhall ceaſe, but the <hi>Bleſſing of God</hi> ſhall neuer ceaſe, being the peculiar exerciſe of the Angels and Saints of the Lord: The more wee practiſe this dutie now, the more we haue our <hi>Conuerſation in heauen</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note>: If it bee a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice tedious vnto vs, heauen it ſelfe will bee a burden. When this dutie is named with the particulars of it, many will be ready to ſtep forth and ſay with him in the Goſpel, <hi>All theſe haue I kept from my youth</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luk. 18.21.</note>: we thanke God (ſay we) for all: but when it commeth to triall, the caſe will be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19491:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like that of the ten lepers. <hi>Tenne were clenſed, but one onely returned to giue God praiſe</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Lu. 17.17.18.</note>. Many enioiers of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, few which returne backe to ſhew their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this appeareth by three things: Firſt by our generall careleſneſſe in the duties of Chriſtian holineſſe. True thankfulneſſe ſtands not in words and ſhewes, but in the practiſe of obedience. The ſonne in the Goſpell who ſaid, <hi>I go ſir, yet wont not</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Matt. 21.30.</note>, was he dutifull? ſo he who ſaith, <hi>I thanke God,</hi> and, <hi>Bleſſed be God, &amp;c.</hi> and yet careth not to diſhonor God, is he thankfull? <hi>Offering prayſe,</hi> and, <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ones way aright,</hi> are coupled together as companions <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 50.23.</note>: where the latter is wanting, the firſt is but a ceremonie. He that hauing receiued a kindneſſe from me, ſhall come to me and ſay, he thanks me, and when he hath turned his backe, ſhall doe me a diſpleaſure; I will neuer thinke him to be thankefull. He that commeth to God, like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, with <hi>Lord I thanke thee,</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note>, in his mouth, and yet maketh no conſcience of ſinne, is but a diſſembler. Hee hath <hi>Iacobs voice, but Eſaus hands</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 27.22.</note>. His words are the words of bleſſing, but his deeds are full of curſedneſſe. Sith then men generally liue in groſſe ſinnes to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, and to the diſcredit of religion, let their words be as they will, yet they ſhall be caſt off as men guiltie of vnthankfulneſſe. The ſecond ſigne of our vnthankfulneſſe is, our paſſing ouer daily fauours without reſpect: Health, libertie, reſt, food, ſucceſſe in our affaires, theſe things are daily beſtowed, yet wee vſe them as ſwine, who eat the maſt, but neuer looke vp to the tree from whence it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: we goe to our meat, to our reſt, to our labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſignification of our acknowledgement from whom theſe things come; or of our opinion, that nothing can do vs good without Gods bleſſing. The third ſigne, is the curſedneſſe of many of our language. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> maketh it a matter of impoſſibilitie, that God ſhould be bleſſed by a curſed toong; <hi>Doeth a fountaine at one place ſend out ſweet water and bitter</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 3.11.</note>? Swearers, raylers, ſlanderers, vicious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19491:8"/>
ſpeakers; as holineſſe cannot dwell in their hearts, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can their toongs bee meſſengers of any true thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe vnto God. To conclude this point then, if we will be thought truly to worſhip God, let vs make conſcience of the dutie of thankfulneſſe: if we will be thought truly thankfull, let vs declare our thankfulneſſe by obedience, let vs take all occaſions to bleſſe God for bleſſing vs, and let vs beware how we defile our tongues with curſedneſſe. Thus much of the dutie to be performed.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the deſcription of the partie to whom it muſt be performed: <hi>The Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> He is the Lord of the whole earth, according to that in the Pſalme: <hi>The Earth is the Lords and all that therein is</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 24.1.</note>. How then is he the God of Iſrael? By <hi>Iſrael</hi> is meant the church &amp; choſen people of God: and therefore the elect are called <hi>The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note>, &amp; the true ſeruants of God, <hi>Iſraelites indeed</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1.47.</note>. The ſtate and Church of Iſrael was a type of the Church of God, ſelected and culled out from the reſt of the world, to be <hi>a peculiar people to himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note>: ſo then; <hi>The God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> is the God of his Church: This is his eſpeciall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as when a great man carieth the name of his Baronry. Hence we are taught two things; the one is this,<note place="margin">The <hi>5.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard of the Propoſition, (that the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael is to be praiſed.</hi>) Now followeth the proofe thereof: <hi>For he hath viſited and redeemed his people, &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme of the proofe is; that God is therefore to be praiſed, becauſe of that great worke which he hath wrought for the good and ſaluation of his Church. Heere we haue two things to ſpeake of: 1. The parties to whom the benefit of this great worke appertaines, and for whoſe ſake it is wrought. 2. The worke it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, they are <hi>Gods people,</hi> that is, thoſe which belong vnto the election of grace, and which are in Gods eternall counſell ordained vnto life. Hence we are taught, <hi>That the bleſſings which doe directly &amp; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne life eternall, onely thoſe are intereſſed in them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>which are Gods people:</hi> This is plaine in this place: For if the queſtion be, whom the Lord did <hi>viſit and redeeme?</hi> It is anſwered by the ſpirit of God ſpeaking in <hi>Zacharie,</hi> that he <hi>viſited and redeemed his people:</hi> ſo ſpeaketh the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 1.21.</note>: there the benefit of <hi>ſaluation</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained onely to Gods people. So againe: <hi>I bring you ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great ioy which ſhall be to all the people.</hi> The birth of Chriſt is a meſſage of ioy, but to whom? not to all: (for all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19491:10"/>
doe not reioyce therein) but onely to the choſen of God: <hi>The people: The,</hi> is a word of ſpeciall diſtinction <note n="b" place="margin">Luk 2 10.</note>. <hi>Peace ſhall be vpon them, and vpon the Iſrael of God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note>. Who be the Iſrael of God, but only thoſe which are here termed <hi>his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> Aske then to whom belongs <hi>Peace and mercy:</hi> what? to all without diſtinction? No: but to the <hi>Iſrael of God:</hi> Conſider the courſe of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. For whom did Chriſt <hi>giue himſelfe?</hi> whom hath hee <hi>redeemed from iniquitie?</hi> whom hath <hi>he purged?</hi> onely thoſe whom he hath choſen out to be <hi>a peculiar people to himſelfe.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaking of his death, tieth it to his ſheepe: <hi>I lay downe my life for my ſheepe</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 10.15.</note>: but who be <hi>his ſheepe?</hi> euen thoſe which are <hi>giuen to him of his Father</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">verſ. 29.</note>. It is a ſpeciall ſpeech of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation which Chriſt vſed in his prayer: <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 17 9.</note>. Many ſuch places might bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together. We heard how God is the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> the God of his Church: Hee is ſo the God of his Church as that none els can haue anie intereſt in his loue.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>We heare much of ſaluation, of life eternall, of the glorie to be reuealed heereafter: Theſe things are great, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are happie which ſhall enioy them. All men almoſt promiſe theſe things vnto themſelues: there is not amongſt vs the verieſt drunkard, or ſwearer, or vicious perſon, or Vſurer, or deſpiſer of good things, but if you talke with him, he will make ſhew of a hope and expectation to bee ſaued; of all other things, he maketh himſelfe beleeue that he is ſureſt of that. But let vs learne this one thing, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate wel of it, That eternal mercy, the benefit of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, the deliuerance from the bondage of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies, theſe things belong not to all: Many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of thoſe which profeſſe Chriſt, and which ſay <hi>Lord, Lord</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Matt 7.21.</note>, yea and which preach Chriſt, ſhall be thruſt out at the day of ſeparation. They be Gods peculiar people onely to whom theſe things appertaine. Looke to it, bee ſure thou art one of Gods people; otherwiſe, when menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of the things which concerne eternall life, I ſay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19491:10"/>
to thee as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou haſt neither part nor fellowſhip in this buſineſſe</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 8.21.</note>. But how ſhall I know (wilt thou ſay) that I am one of Gods people? I will tell thee plainly: How is a man knowne to be one of the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects? one (as we ſay) of the Kings liege people? Euen by this: his obedience to the holeſome lawes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So in this: holie obedience is the marke and badge of Gods people: <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 10.27.</note>. <hi>Yee are my friends, if you doe whatſoeuer I command you</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 15.14.</note>. It is not the twanging of religion vpon the toong, but the practiſe of holines in the life, which ſheweth a man to be a Chriſtian: Gods <hi>peculiar people are zealous of good works</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note>. To this therefore we are now come: Wouldeſt thou bee ſure that the treaſures of happineſſe which are ſtored vp in Chriſt, belong to thee? enquire into thy ſelfe whether thou be one of Gods people: Remember how Gods people are diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>They heare my voice,</hi> ſaith our Sauior. If Chriſts voice in his word be not euen muſicke in thy eares, yea <hi>ſweeter than honie, and the honie combe</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note>, <hi>dearer than thouſands of gold and ſiluer</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 119.72.</note>, <hi>the ioy and reioycing of thy heart</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 15.16.</note>: If the fruits of holineſſe appeare not in thy life, but rather the <hi>vnfruitfull works of darkneſſe</hi>

            <p>Now wee are come to the worke it ſelfe, where manie things come in order to be touched. 1. The fountain &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning therof, <hi>(He hath viſited).</hi> 2. The generall nature of the worke it ſelfe, <hi>(Redeemed).</hi> 3. The meanes of it, <hi>(And hath raiſed vp the horne, &amp;c.)</hi> 4. The euidence of it; the teſtimonie of the Prophets, in whom the couenant of grace and the oath of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> are at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19491:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(<hi>As he ſpake by the mouth, &amp;c.</hi> 5. The end of it, <hi>(That we being deliuered &amp;c.)</hi> Of theſe ſhall be ſpoken in order.</p>
            <p>The beginning and fountaine of all is Gods viſitation: <hi>(He hath viſited)</hi> There is a twofold viſiting aſcribed to God in Scripture: One of diſpleaſure: <hi>In the day of my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation I will viſit their ſinne vpon them</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Exod. 32.34.</note>. <hi>The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of his place to viſit the ſinne of the inhabitants of the earth</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Iſay 26.21.</note>. The other is of mercy; <hi>The Lord viſited Sarah as he had ſaid</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 21.1.</note>, that is, he performed the good which he had promiſed. In this ſenſe, the day of ones conuerſion is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the day of viſitation</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.12.</note>: So then heere: <hi>God hath viſited,</hi> that is, he hath graciouſly and mercifully looked vpon his people, he hath ſcene and beheld with a pitifull eie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and bondage of his choſen, and he is now, as it were, come amongſt them to ſhew them kindneſſe. This <hi>viſiting</hi> on Gods part hauing this ſignification, and being heere put in the firſt ranke, is the ground and ſpring of all which followeth;<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> and it affoords vs this doctrine: <hi>That the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy, and free grace of God, is the beginning and the fountaine of all thoſe good things which doe concerne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> Conſider the place: Manie things are heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Redemption: of a <hi>Horne of ſaluation;</hi> of a <hi>Couenant and oath</hi> of grace: But whence proceed all theſe, but from the ſole mercie of God; euen from his gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to viſite his people? Where viſiting is, there is preſuppoſed a very wofull eſtate: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſit now yonder curſed woman,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iehu</hi> of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> meaning to reſpect her aboue her deſert <note n="z" place="margin">1. King. 9.34.</note>. It is eaſie to ſhew out of the Scripture how the loue, mercie, and grace of God are noted, as the beginning of thoſe things which concerne ſaluation. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the old Iſraelites) <hi>did not ſet his loue vpon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe ye were moe in number than any people,  but becauſe the Lord loued you, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 7.7.8.</note>. Now the people of Iſrael were a type of Gods people: Canaan a type of heauen: it was Gods free loue which moued him to bring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19491:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them into Canaan; it is his free grace for which hee vouchſafes to aduance vs to heauen. When mention is made of the courſe and order of our ſaluation, theſe and the like ſpeeches ſtil come in: <hi>So God loued the world</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note>, <hi>the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 1.5.</note>, <hi>freely by his grace</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note>, <hi>not by the works of righteouſneſſe which we had done, but according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note>, <hi>not that we loued God, but that he loued vs</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.10.</note>, <hi>who hath giuen vnto him first</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 11.35.</note>? Theſe ſpeeches agree with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech heere vſed, and doe ſhew plainly that there was nothing in man to mooue the Lord to reach out his arme of deliuerance; all proceeded from the abſolute and vndeſerued freedome of his grace. Manie things there were in man to prouoke God in his iuſtice finally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, nothing which might induce him to ſhew the leaſt degree of fauour.</p>
            <p>Beſides that this doth ouerthrow all Popiſh opinion of merit,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> and (which is the maine end of all) ſets out the grace and mercy of God to the full; it ſerueth to quicken in vs that duty of thankfulneſſe, of which we heard before, and which <hi>Zacharie</hi> did here performe. A great bleſſing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth great thanks, but the freer the bleſſing is, the greater ſhould the thankfulneſſe be. <hi>All my fathers houſe</hi> (ſayd <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> to <hi>Dauid) were but dead men before my Lord the King, yet diddest thou ſet thy ſeruant among them which did eat at thine owne table</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">2. Sa. 19.28.</note>. The leſſe deſert he found in himſelfe, the more deeply did hee hold himſelfe bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dauid:</hi> ſo that when we looke vpon the greatneſſe of the bleſſing on the one ſide, (namely, life eternall, and a kingdom which can not be ſhaken) and then the ſmalneſſe of our owne deſert on the other ſide, who were but dead men before the Lord, <hi>euen dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Eph 2.1.</note>, we may well ſay with <hi>Dauid, What ſhall wee render vnto the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 116.12.</note>? This muſt needs condemne our carnall minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſome things doe ſometimes fall from vs, by way of thankfulneſſe for outward things; as health, peace, ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weather, and ſuch like: but the greateſt bleſſing, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19491:12"/>
chiefeſt fauor, and to which of al other we can lay the leaſt claime, is ſcarſely once made mention of: <hi>Bleſſed be God that hath viſited vs when we were dead in ſinne; thanks be to God for his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus. How are we bound to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, who hath ſhewed vs this mercy to redeeme vs!</hi> It is a rare thing to heare of ſuch a ſpeech. It ſheweth that we minde onely <hi>earthly things</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note>. Corne and Wine, a full basket, and a ful barne, theſe things wil affect vs; but the Lords merciful viſitation in his Son Chriſt, in pulling vs out of the iawes of Sathan cannot mooue vs: It is a fearefull ſigne, euen that we are enthralled vnto Sathan, and in the very <hi>bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 8.23.</note>. For did we feele and apprehend our owne deſert, to be eternally forſaken, and the riches of Gods mercy in viſiting vs with his ſaluation, our ſpirits would be ſo raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed therewith, that all other things would ſeeme vile and baſe in compariſon of this one. Thus much of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this great worke, which ſerueth notably to beate downe Merit, and to ſtirre vp thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>The generall nature of the benefit is ſet downe in this word <hi>(Redeemed.)</hi> To <hi>redeeme</hi> is (as we know) to buy out: the very word in the common vſage of it preſuppoſeth a bondage and captiuitie.<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Whereupon iuſt occaſion is giuen vs to conſider <hi>that miſerable ſeruitude in which by nature we are all.</hi> This <hi>ſeruitude</hi> is ſaid to be vnder <hi>the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>

            <p>Here is firſt a good lecture of humilitie, the beſt and the hardeſt leſſon of all others: the beſt, becauſe I may ſay of it as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of <hi>Bethel; This is the gate of heauen</hi>

Where we haue two things to conſider:<note place="margin">The points to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Sermon.</note> 1. A matter done: <hi>(He hath raiſed vp the horne of ſaluation vnto vs.)</hi> 2. The place where it is done, <hi>(In the houſe of his ſeruant Dauid.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former point, two things muſt bee inquired. 1. Who is meant by this <hi>Horne of ſaluation.</hi> 2. Why the partie meant by this title is ſo ſtiled. He that is heere meant by the <hi>Horne of ſaluation,</hi> is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> For <hi>vnder heauen there is giuen no other name whereby we must be ſaued</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note>, and, <hi>to him giue all the Prophets witneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note>. If he then be the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whom all the Prophets pointed at, as the alone reſtorer of mankind, if there be no other meanes of ſaluation; who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19491:14"/>
ſhould bee meant by the <hi>Horne of ſaluation,</hi> but onely Hee? Now for the next, why hee ſhould be ſo entitled, it will eaſily appeare, if we conſider the vſual forme of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture. The ſpirit of God is wont by this word <hi>(Horne)</hi> to note out <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Strength:</hi> as in thoſe words, <hi>All the hornes of the wicked will I breake</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 75.10.</note>, that is, <hi>I will take downe and abate the height and ſtrength of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaking of the ruine of the kingdome of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>The horne of Moab is cut off</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 48.25.</note>. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and greatneſſe of ſtates and kingdomes and common-wealthes is often deſigned in Scripture by that word, as in <hi>Daniel</hi> and elſewhere. It is a ſpeech borrowed from hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beaſts, whoſe ſtrength lieth in that part, and which vſe it both for defence if they be aſſaulted, and for offence if they haue an intent to vanquiſh. So that by an <hi>Horne of ſaluation</hi> is rightly vnderſtood (as it is vſually tranſlated) <hi>a Mightie ſaluation,</hi> or, <hi>a Sauiour of admirable and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power.</hi> Heereupon then wee haue occaſion to diſcourſe of the power and ſtrength of our Sauiour, and that two waies. 1. As it concerneth the ſaluation of his Elect. 2. As it reſpecteth the confuſion of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, this is the doctrine: <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt is euery way furniſhed with ſufficiencie of power,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Doctrine.</note> for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the work of Redemption which he vndertooke.</hi> This is eaſily prooued. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Col. 1.9.</note>. If all <hi>Fulneſſe,</hi> ſurely then <hi>Fulneſſe of power:</hi> and the word <hi>(dwell)</hi> is very effectuall, ſignifying the perpetuitie of his power: it is not for a turne or two, but eternally remaining in him, for the beginning, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perfecting of the ſaluation of his choſen. Againe, it is ſaid of him, that <hi>God the Father hath ſealed him</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note>. God hath (as it were) ſet a marke vpon him, and noted him out, as the onely Sauiour. <hi>He hath lifted him vp</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 5.31.</note>. Now it were a diſparagement to the wiſedome of God, to call the whole world to a dependance vpon him for their ſaluation, if hee were not in full and abſolute maner able to effect it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19491:15"/>
if we conſider the nature of that which hee was to doe for mans redeeming, we ſhall ſee his power to effect it. He had two things to doe, if hee would procure our ſaluation. Firſt he was to ſaue from deſtruction (which was due for the multitude of our ſinnes.) Next he was to inueſt into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe, into which (becauſe of our ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe) the iuſtice of God could giue vs no admiſſion. To doe the former of theſe, he tooke vpon him our ſinnes, he <hi>bare them in his body</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.24.</note>, hee was <hi>made ſinne</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.21.</note>, and, <hi>that hand-writing which was againſt vs, he tooke out of the way</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note>, and vpon his croſſe <hi>triumphed</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">verſ. 15.</note> ouer all our ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. To accompliſh the latter, hee put vpon vs his owne righteouſneſſe, that ſo wee being clothed with that <hi>white rayment</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 3.18.</note>, &amp; with the <hi>garment of ſaluation</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iſay 61.10.</note>, as <hi>Iacob</hi> with the apparell of his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 27.15.</note>, might obtaine the bleſſing. Thus is that fulfilled which was ſaid: <hi>God gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue life euerlaſting</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 3 16.</note>. <hi>Should not periſh,</hi> that he did by being our <hi>Redemption</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note>: <hi>But haue life euerlaſting,</hi> that hee brought to paſſe by becomming <hi>our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note>. Many things might eaſily bee produced for this purpoſe, but theſe may ſuffice. Onely this one thing is to be noted, that the <hi>ſaluation wrought</hi> by Chriſt, as it may be called <hi>mightie,</hi> becauſe of the preſent fulneſſe, ſo doeth it deſerue the ſame name, becauſe, being done nothing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vndoe it. <hi>Othniel</hi> deliuered the Iſraelites from <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> and is therefore called their <hi>Sauiour</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Iud. 3.9.</note>, yet they fell after into the hand of <hi>Moab</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">verſ. 12.</note>. <hi>Ehud</hi> reſcued them from the Moabites <note n="x" place="margin">verſ. 28. &amp;c.</note>, yet became they ſeruants to the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites <note n="y" place="margin">Iud. 4.2.</note>. And a Phyſician is ſometimes a meanes of health, in one diſeaſe, yet the ſame partie may after ſicken, yea and die for all that. But in this worke of redemption it is otherwiſe: it is a thorow peece of worke. <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp;c. ſhall not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death to life</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh 5.24.</note>. <hi>I giue my ſheepe eternall life, they ſhall neuer periſh &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 10.28.</note>. Thus wee ſee how Chriſt is a <hi>Horne
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19491:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſaluation:</hi> The <hi>ſaluation</hi> procured by him is plentifull, (euery way anſwerable to our ſpirituall need) and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, no ſinne of man, no malice of hell is able to vndoe it.</p>
            <p>The firſt vſe heereof is,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> to let vs ſee the wrong which Popiſh religion doth to the whole myſterie of Chriſt. He is called (as we haue heard) <hi>a Horne of ſaluation,</hi> becauſe of his abſolute ſufficiencie to effect that worke of ſaluation which he hath vndertaken. Papiſts, as though Chriſt were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, or his <hi>horne</hi> ſtrong enough to batter down the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the diuel, and fully and wholly to reconcile vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, adioyne other things, as it were to ſupply that which is wanting in him, or to perfit that which hee hath begun: as for example: with his offers of grace, our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; with his righteouſneſſe, our good works; with his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for eternall puniſhment, our ſatisfaction for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment, either heere in Earth or in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; with his interceſſion, the interceſſion of Saints. Thus they haue maymed the worke of Chriſt; and by their groſſe and vnfitting patcheries haue vtterly defaced it. We muſt beleeue the Scripture, which calleth Chriſt an <hi>Horne of ſaluation,</hi> that is, (as it ſeemeth to be expounded by the Apoſtle) one, <hi>who hath by himſelfe purged our ſinnes</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note>: that which he hath done is a worke complete and entire; hee himſelfe onely, without any aſſiſtance, hath and doeth effect it. Many things are left vnto vs by way of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but nothing by way of promoting that which hee hath begun. Thus this phraſe <hi>(a Horne of ſaluation)</hi> is as an <hi>Horne</hi> of iron, to breake downe all thoſe vnwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupplies, which the Church of Rome conioineth and coupleth with the abſolute and all-ſufficient worke of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> this is a doctrine full of comfort to euerie humbled Chriſtian: as for example: Thou ſeeſt weakneſſe in thy ſelfe, of vnderſtanding, of will, of affection, of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou art vnable to doe any thing by which God might be pleaſed, or thine owne ſoule helped forward vnto life:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19491:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Turne now the eies of thy faith to this <hi>Horne of ſaluation:</hi> thou ſhalt not finde ſo much weakneſſe in thy ſelfe, as thou ſhalt find might and power in him; not ſo much emptines in thy ſelfe, as fulneſſe in him; not ſo much pouerty in thy ſelfe, as plentie in him; &amp; happie thou if the apprehenſion of thine own weaknes, make thee to long to be eſtabliſhed and vpheld by his power. Offenders were wont of old to flie for ſuccour and ſafegard to the <hi>Hornes of the altar</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1. Kin. 1.50.</note>: ſo when thou feeleſt thy ſelfe purſued by Sathan, and euen to be arreſted by the wrath of God, flie to this <hi>Horne of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> labour to hold faſt vpon it by faith: ſay, as did <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to the Angel: <hi>I will not let thee goe except thou bleſſe me</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note>. This is the ſureſt couert: <hi>thou ſhalt be ſure vnder his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his trueth ſhall bee thy ſhield and buckler</hi>

The <hi>Houſe of Dauid</hi> was the ſtocke royall, and to his lawfull heires belonged the crowne of <hi>Iudah;</hi> but, at this time, <hi>Dauids</hi> kingdome was decaied, the glorie of it was dimmed and defaced, the gouernment and ſoueraigntie was fallen to ſtrangers, the next heire, as the right of his ſucceſſion was not ordinarily and vniuerſally knowne, ſo he liued in poore eſtate: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was become a Carpenter.

As it is cleere in the old Teſtament, that the Meſſias ſhould be made of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid</hi> according to the fleſh; ſo the new Teſtament e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently ſheweth how the ſame was fulfilled in Chriſt: for this cauſe the Euangeliſts doe labour to make manifeſt the deſcent of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> from <hi>Dauid.

So that our Sauiour, by <hi>Marie</hi> was borne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was next heire to the crowne: For although he came not of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> according to the fleſh, yet being the next of his kinne, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being childleſſe, hee was by the law (of force among the Iewes) to ſucceed him as his lawfull heire. This right of Chriſts was apparent: the <hi>Starre</hi>

            <p>So that the firſt doctrine now, is this:<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That for the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirmation of Faith, it is needfull to note the order &amp; agreement of the Scriptures.</hi> For indeed, wherupon was <hi>Zecharie</hi> his faith built, but vpon the courſes of holie writ? vpon the accompliſhment of the ancient Prophets,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19491:20"/>
which he now beheld. He was able to ſay to himſelfe; <hi>This which I now ſee to come to paſſe, I am ſure is no other, but that which formerly hath beene foretold; as the Prophets ſpake, ſo is it now fulfilled.</hi> To this very thing Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts: <hi>Search the Scriptures, they are they, which teſtifie of me</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note>. By this he endeuoured to ſettle his Diſciples faith: <hi>Hee began at Moſes, and all the Prophets, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them in all the Scriptures, the things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Luc. 24.27.</note>. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> courſe for the eſtabliſhing of his hearers: <hi>Hee diſputed by the Scriptures</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 17.2.</note>; hee ſaid <hi>no other things, than thoſe which Moſes and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 26.22.</note>. Theſe and the like ſayings we read often, <hi>That the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 26.56.</note>, <hi>This is done that the Scripture ſhould bee fulfilled</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Mar. 14.49.</note>, <hi>Thus the Scripture was fulfilled</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mark. 15.28.</note>; which argueth the care and purpoſe which the Spirit of God had, to ground our iudgements vpon the Scripture. So in our times when we ſee the ſame things happen, which wee read in Scripture to haue hapned; when we ſee ſuch things come to paſſe, as we find prophecied in Scripture, it is a great comfort, &amp; a ſpeciall ſtrengthning vnto faith. <hi>So did they to the Prophets,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 5.12.</note>; ſo it was <hi>Then,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>This ſheweth what enemies they are to their own faith, and comfort, who are wilfully ſtrangers in the Scripture. Thou ſaieſt, thou doeſt beleeue in Chriſt; but how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou that hee is the Chriſt in whom thou muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; what aſſurance haſt thou, that hee is the perſon promiſed? When Satan, or the doubtings of thine own hart ſhall thus ſift thee, what certainty art thou able to allege? and what is become of thy faith, which is built vpon ſuch a weake foundation? If thou didſt dwell in an eſtate of land, of which thou couldeſt ſhew no better euidence, thou wouldeſt thinke to bee quickly ſhut out of doores. The Lord hath preciſely ſet downe particulars, (ſuch hath beene his care to eſtabliſh our faith:) if wee let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lie like ſome needleſſe Hiſtorie, turning ouer (as too
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19491:20"/>
many doe) the cardes oftner than the leaues of the Bible, that wee might be able to ſay (as euery Chriſtian ought) <hi>Thus it is written, and thus I beleeue;</hi> well may wee talke of faith, but, that faith ſhould be where there is ſuch little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the rule and life &amp; ground of faith (which is the Scripture) it is vnpoſſible. <hi>Theſe things were written that we might beleeue</hi>

            <p>The ſecond doctrine of the place is:<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That God from the worlds beginning foretold by Prophets all things concerning Chriſt.</hi> This is manifeſt out of the courſe of the place in hand, &amp; is eaſily confirmed. Firſt in generall, it is ſaid, that vnto Chriſt <hi>al the Prophets giue witnes</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note>. Chriſt appealed to the Scriptures of the old Teſtament <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note>, and in his diſcourſe with the two diſciples iourneying to Emmaus, he found in euery of the prophets ſomething touching himſelfe <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 24.27.</note>. Secondly, if any ſhall exactly peruſe the old Teſtament, he ſhall finde euery ſpecialty touching Chriſt diſtinctly ſet downe: as namely, when he ſhould be borne <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note>, where he ſhould bee borne <note n="c" place="margin">Mic. 5.2.</note>, of what ſtocke <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 132.11.</note>, of what kinde of woman <note n="e" place="margin">Iſay 7.14.</note>, what maner of perſon, both God <note n="f" place="margin">Iſay 19.6.</note> and Man <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note>, how he ſhould bee entertained <note n="h" place="margin">Iſay 53.2.3. &amp;c.</note>, for what end hee ſhould come <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 61.1.2.3.</note>, by whom he ſhould be betraied <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 41.9.</note>, what maner of death he ſhould die <note n="l" place="margin">Numb. 21.9. with Ioh. 3.14.</note>, how he ſhould be vſed in his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 22. at large.</note>, where he ſhould be buried <note n="n" place="margin">Iſay 53.9.</note>, how long hee ſhould abide in the graue <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh 1.17. with Math. 12.40.</note>, that he ſhould riſe from death <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 16.10.</note>, that he ſhould aſcend into heauen <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 68.18. with Eph. 4.8.</note>. Theſe &amp; many more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances than theſe, the Prophets from the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning did ſet downe very exactly: ſo that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing befell Chriſt from the firſt moment of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vntill the laſt period of his time heere on earth, (I meane of thoſe things which are reuealed to haue befallen him; and which befell him as our Mediatour) of which a man experienced in the Scripture might not truely ſaie, <hi>Thus and thus it hapned, as the Lord ſpake by his Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides the ceremonies in the Temple and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19491:21"/>
in the daily Sacrifices and Sacrificers, all of them ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing out ſomething or other in the Chriſt to come, who was the ſubſtance of euery type, and the bodie of euerie repreſentation. It is woorthy any mans paines to marke and obſerue how the whole myſtery of Chriſt is lapped vp in the Prophecies of the old Teſtament, and how the ſame is explaned, laid open and vnfolded in the ſtorie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the new: The pith and marrow and ſubſtance of both being this, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for euer</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note>. The reaſon heereof on Gods part is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: Firſt the confirmation of our Faith: <hi>Theſe things were written that we might beleeue</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 20.31.</note>. Our faith by this courſe is ſtrengthned after this maner: we ſee by this exact foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Prophets, that the whole courſe of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a matter framed by God, and the whole order thereof in euery part and limme ſet downe in his eternall wiſedome and prouidence: out of which wee may gather and conclude the certeintie thereof, inaſmuch as a plot which God hath laid, all the power of Sathan cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Secondly, many baſe wrongs, many vile vſages, and indignities befell our Sauiour in the daies of his fleſh, the conſideration whereof might make a man to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could be the Sauiour of mankinde. But when we ſee that euerie ſuch ſpecialtie is foretold by the Prophets, and ſo, that nothing came to paſſe but according to Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and that for ſome ſpeciall end, that doubt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, and thoſe particulars of his debaſement, become grounds of comfort and of reioicing vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Vſe.</note>Now (for a vſe of this doctrine) wee ſee heere (as in a glaſſe) the care which God hath had in all ages, from the verie cradle (as it were) of the world, for the good and comfort of his Church.

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie age hath beene furniſhed with Prophets, and euerie prophet furniſhed with gifts, to inſtruct the Church in the myſterie of Chriſt.

For the making of the beſt profit by this point, let vs looke a little further into it. By the foretellings of the Prophets in this place, <hi>Zecharie</hi> (no doubt) vnderſtandeth the old Teſtament, which is there-therefore called, <hi>the Word of the Prophets</hi>

               <note n="r" place="margin">2 Tim. 3 16.</note>: and the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Foundation of the Church,</hi> maketh it to be both <hi>Prophets</hi> (the old Teſtament) and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 2.20.</note>, the new Teſtament: the body and frame whereof, albeit it was not all compiled by Apoſtles, yet the doctrine was taught and preached by the Apoſtles, whoſe <hi>vnderſtanding Chriſt opened</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Three things noted touching the Scriptures by occaſion of this <hi>3.</hi> Doctrine.</note>The firſt is, the <hi>Maieſtie of it.</hi> For how muſt not that needs bee full of Maieſtie and of admirable excellencie which proceedeth out of the mouth of the moſt high? We ſee in experience when bookes come to our hands, which containe ſome briefes of the Orations and ſpeeches of the King, how apt we be to carie an higher eſtimation of them, than of other ordinarie writings; and al is, becauſe we meaſure the words by the worth and dignitie of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: ſo in the Scripture; it comming from a God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Maieſtie, there muſt needs be in it more than ſteps or prints of excellencie. Heereupon they are called, <hi>the Great,</hi> or, <hi>Stately,</hi> or, <hi>honorable Things of the Law</hi>

them <hi>the Wonders of the Law</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Pſa. 119.18</note>. The Law of God ſeemed to him ſo full of many admirable things, and the ſame ſo full of heauenly brightneſſe and glorie, that his naturall eyes were euen dazled therewith, therefore hee deſireth God to doe a cure vpon his ſight, that hee may be able to behold them: <hi>Open mine eies, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he taught as one hauing authoritie</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Matth. 7.29</note>; there was another maner of ſtate in his words, than in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Sermons and Lectures of the Scribes; And ſo (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall obſerue it,) ſhall ſee a kinde of Maieſtie in the word of God reuealed in the Scriptute, more than in any other writings.</p>
            <p>The vſe heereof is,<note place="margin">The Vſe of the <hi>1.</hi> note touching the Scripture.</note> to admoniſh vs to beware of al ſlight and baſe and contemptuous vſing of Gods word. That which God hath ſpoken muſt needs be maieſticall. If the Scripture be ſuch an euidence of his eternall and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Maieſtie, who ſhall dare to vſe it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? The Maieſtie of the Scripture is drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>undrie, waies into contempt: Firſt, if it be in preaching handled negligently and irreuerently. Secondly, if the phraſes and ſentences of it be drawne into common ſpeech: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be heard, idlie, careleſly, ſcornfully, ſleepily, which is the ordinarie indignitie offred to the Maieſtie of Gods Word. If it were but one of <hi>Eſops</hi> fables, or a tale of <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> it could not be heard with leſſe reſpect, or with more diſdaine, than it is by many. Yet, euen <hi>Eglon,</hi> though but a Heathen, was better than ſuch; who when hee was told by <hi>Ehud,</hi> that he had a <hi>meſſage to him from God, roſe out of his throne</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iud. 3.20.</note>. When <hi>Pilate</hi> heard of hauing to doe with <hi>the Sonne of God, he trembled</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 19.8.</note>. Well then, when the Miniſter addreſſeth himſelfe to the reading and to the opening of the Scriptures, remember wee, that that which wee ſhall heare is the voice of God: He ſpeaketh by <hi>Mans mouth;</hi> let vs thinke with our ſelues how great Maieſtie muſt needs be in his words; and let vs labour to make our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in hearing, ſutable to the ſtate and excellencie
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19491:23"/>
of that which is deliuered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond note touching the Scripture is the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it.</hi> Is it Gods voice? Then of it ſelfe it is of ſufficient credit, and needs no other teſtimonie to confirme it: It is alſo an abſolute Iudge for the ouer-ruling of all doubts, and the determining of all caſes and queſtions in Religion. For who is higher than God? when his mouth and word hath giuen the ſentence, what exception ſhall wee make, or to whom ſhall wee appeale? Thus you ſee that heerup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded the authoritie of the Scripture: of which authoritie of the Scripture you ſee alſo that there are two branches: One, that it is of ſufficient credit to it ſelfe: The other, that it is in matters of Religion the ſupreme Iudge. Touching the firſt, wee haue this proofe: <hi>I receaue not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the record of men</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 5.34.</note>. His meaning is, that hee was of credit enough of himſelfe, and needed no teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie from any other, for the confirming of that which hee had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>red. That which is true of Chriſt, is true of the word of Chriſt, which is the Scripture: It is the voice of God, and needs no other witneſſe to avowe it. <hi>If wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) the witneſſe of men, the witneſſe of God is greater</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.9.</note>. There is none greater or more certaine, than the diuine teſtimonie. This is enough, <hi>God hath ſpoken it;</hi> where ſhall we haue a witneſſe of better credit? Now for the ſupreme authoritie which the Scripture hath in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is the ſame in the Church that the Law is in the common-wealth: <hi>To the Law</hi> (ſaith God) and <hi>to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iſay. 8.20.</note>. Chriſt ſubmitted his doctrine to the deciſion of the Scripture <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note>: So did <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 28.23.</note>. An Vmpire for matters of Religion had need of three things. Firſt, it muſt be of that nature, that we may bee aſſured that the verdit thereof is true. Secondly, it muſt be ſuch, as from which it ſhall not be lawfull to appeale. Thirdly, it muſt be indifferent, and without partialitie. Now nothing hath theſe three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but the Scripture, and therefore that onely is fit to bee the ſupreme Iudge in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:19491:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>This makes firſt againſt the Papiſts: Their opinion is,<note place="margin">The Vſe of the <hi>2.</hi> note touching the Scripture.</note> that the Authoritie of the Scripture dependeth vpon the Church, that is, that it is therefore Canonicall and of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine credit and authoritie, becauſe the Church, (that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when the matter is well ſifted, the Pope) hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. This one place is ſufficient to ouerthrow this fancie. The Scripture is the voice of God: ſhall not the voice of God bee of credit to it ſelfe? muſt men come in for a witneſſe to iuſtifie that vnto vs which God hath ſaid is true? God forbid. But, how ſhall I know (thou wilt ſay) that God hath ſpoken this or that? I anſwer; what, by the Church? Thou (perhaps) wilt ſay ſo: but I demand; How ſhall I know, which is the Church? The Church muſt prooue it ſelfe by the Scripture, and therefore the Scripture hath not its dependance vpon the Church.

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>s: it is <hi>mightie in operation &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note>, <hi>it will make thy heart to burne within thee</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 24.32.</note>. He that will not beleeue this witneſſe, will beleeue none. It is the Churches Miniſtry which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Scripture, but it is not the Churches authority which maketh it to be Canonicall. Another opinion of the Papiſts is, that the Scripture is not the abſolute Iudge in matters of Religion, but the Church, that is, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, ſometimes the conſent of the Fathers; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, the decree of a generall Councell; ſometime the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Pope, whoſe faith cannot faile. They accuſe the Scripture to bee obſcure, imperfit, the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and therefore vnfit to bee a Iudge. But if that be true which is heere, that the Scripture is the voice of God, who ſhall be more fit to determine? But (thou ſaieſt) how ſhall we be certaine of the ſenſe? I anſwer: The Scripture is the interpreter of it ſelfe, as the Law of the Land is of it ſelfe: The Scripture is <hi>Light</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 119.105.</note>: As we ſee the light by the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19491:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
light, ſo the Scripture by it ſelfe. Who ſhall iudge what is Gods meaning but himſelfe? Scripture with Scripture muſt be conferred <note n="m" place="margin">This is the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Act. 9.22.</hi>
               </note>, and that is the way to find the truth. Secondly, this point may be fitly applied to our own occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: There is betwixt vs and our Teachers controuerſie about ſundry things: Theſe and theſe things are vrged and perſwaded, as good &amp; neceſſary: ſuch and ſuch things are cried out vpon, as euill and vngodly. The Preacher draweth one way by exhortation, we draw cleane contrary by our conuerſation. He ſaith we muſt doe thus and thus, we thinke it to be more than needs: He ſaith this or that is a groſſe ſinne, and will bring vs to hell if we continue in it; we ſuppoſe there is no danger in committing it. Heere is now a queſtion, and by whom ſhall it bee decided? If we will haue a Iudge which is able to giue an abſolute ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, let vs appeale to the Scripture, let vs hearken what God ſaith; where ſhall wee finde a more ſufficient arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ee is the onely <hi>Law-giuer</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 4.12.</note> of his Church. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie action, euery courſe muſt ſtand or fall at his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And where or whence ſhall we know what his will is, but in the Scripture? The Prophets and Apoſtles haue written and ſpoken, but God <hi>ſpake by their mouths:</hi> I would we could bee perſwaded to yeeld to the Lords verdit reuealed in the Scripture: What a notable refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſundry groſſe euils would ſoone enſue? Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things which wee goe about to perſwade, as, diligence in the worſhip of God, care to heare and to profit by the Word, ſanctifying the Sabbath, Chaſtitie, Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, Mercie, Peaceableneſſe and ſuch like, ſure we are, we haue the Scripture on our ſides, and men haue nothing but humour, and cuſtome, and obſtinacie to oppoſe. If wee will not yeeld to the iudgement of the Scripture now for our conuerſion, we ſhall ere long be forced to yeeld vnto it for our confuſion.</p>
            <p>The third thing touching the Scripture noted hence, is the <hi>Trueth of it:</hi> which followeth from hence neceſſarilie.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19491:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God is the <hi>God of Trueth</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 31.5.</note>. How can there bee any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth in that which hee hath deliuered? I remember that for confirmation this doeth often come in, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iſay 1.20. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note>. Heerupon are thoſe commendations of the word of God: <hi>The iudgements of the Lord are truth</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 19.9.</note>; <hi>Thy word is truth</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 17.17.</note>; <hi>The word of truth, which is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Col. 1.5.</note>. And not without cauſe: For there is nothing related in it as done, but it was ſo, as is reported, with euerie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: There is nothing mentioned as a matter to be done, but it ſhall ſo come to paſſe, as is foretold. <hi>It is more eaſie that heauen and earth ſhould paſſe away, than that one tittle of the Law ſhould fall</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk. 16.17.</hi> The Vſe of the <hi>3.</hi> note touching the Scripture.</note>. This is alſo a needful note. It is probable, that the greateſt part of men doe not thinke, that there is that abſolute trueth and certaintie in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but that they doe ſuppoſe it rather to bee an idle tale, or frightfull ſound to amaze fooles, full of terrible threatnings, but yet lighter than vanitie in performance. Therefore it is meet to hold this firme, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the voice of him who cannot lie; Euery curſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it ſhall fall vpon the vnrepentant; and euery bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing promiſed therein, ſhall be made good to the ſoule of euery true beleeuer.</p>
            <p>The fourth generall point in this part touching the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of redemption is, <hi>What the Prophets ſpake:</hi> Where we haue to note two things: 1. The ſumme of that which God by the Prophets promiſed to doe by Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 71.2. The inducement or reaſon moouing God ſo to doe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 72.73.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, wheras mention is made of <hi>enemies and haters,</hi> we muſt inquire what and who they be. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their nature in generall, they are ſpirituall Enemies, or enemies in ſpiritual things, or for ſpirituall reſpects <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note>. The chiefe of them is Sathan; He was the firſt, and is therefore ſtiled, <hi>A murtherer from the beginning</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 8.44.</note>, and an <hi>Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Reu. 12.9.</note>: hee <hi>deſireth vs to winnow vs</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Luk. 22 31.</note>, and <hi>walketh about ſeeking to deuoure</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.8.</note>. Another enemie is ſinne, a dangerous
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19491:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enemie, lurking in our boſome, and ſtill labouring the ruine and ouerthrow of the ſoule: <hi>It fighteth againſt the ſoule</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.11.</note>, and <hi>lusteth againſt the ſpirit</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gal 5.17.</note>. A third enemie is death, ſo entitled by the Apoſtle <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.26</note>, and is therefore ſaid to haue a <hi>Sting</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Verſe 53.</note>, by which it wounds the ſoule, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it within the compaſſe of eternall miſery. A fourth ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is the world; that is, wicked, vnregenerate, godleſſe men. Theſe be the enemies and haters of Gods people. <hi>The world hateth you,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour to ſuch <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 15.19.</note>; and, <hi>In the world you ſhall haue affliction</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 16.33.</note>; and, <hi>Yee ſhall be hated of all nations for my names ſake</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 24.9.</note>. Now let vs alſo ſee how true this is, that Chriſt bringeth <hi>Deliuerance</hi> from theſe <hi>Enemies:</hi> Firſt, for <hi>deliuerance</hi> from Sathan, it is plaine: <hi>For this purpoſe appeared the Sonne of God, that hee might looſe the works of the diuell</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.8.</note>; and, <hi>God hath deliuered vs from the power of darkneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note>; <hi>Chriſt hath ſpoiled the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Col. 2.15.</note>. Secondly, for <hi>deliuerance from ſinne,</hi> the words are expreſſe: <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne, &amp;c. But thanks bee to God that hath giuen vs victorie, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.56.57.</note>. Thirdly, for <hi>deliuerance</hi> from death; <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſwallowed vp into victorie</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.54.</note>. Laſtly, touching <hi>deliuerance</hi> from the World: <hi>Be of good comfort</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>I haue ouercome the World</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 16.33.</note>. Let vs proceed yet further and enquire into the maner of this <hi>deliuerance:</hi> Concerning which, I will briefely open two things. 1. The ſubſtance and ground of the <hi>deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi> 2. The maner of declaring it. The ground of the <hi>deliuerance</hi> is the merit of Chriſts death. Hee was <hi>made ſinne</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.21.</note>, and ſo died, and in death encountred with him, <hi>who had the power of death, the diuell</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note>. By being made ſinne, hee tooke away ſinne, by dying hee ouercame death: ſinne being aboliſhed, and death ſubdued, the kingdome of the diuell was vtterly ouerthrowne. As for the maner of declaring and manifeſting this deliuerance, it is either in this life, or heereafter. In this life he deliuereth from Satan, by reſtraining his rage, by limiting his malice,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19491:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by not giuing vs ouer to his aſſaults: <hi>I haue praied that thy faith faile not</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Luc. 22.32.</note>. He deliuereth from ſinne by ſanctifying vs by his ſpirit, by killing the ſtrength of our corruption, by transforming vs more and more into the image of God. <hi>Sinne ſhall not haue dominion ouer you</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note>. He deliuereth from death, by taking away the naturall feare of it, by aſſuring that it ſhall be a paſſage into glorie. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that <hi>being looſed</hi> he ſhould <hi>be with Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note>. He deliuereth from the world, by ordering the rage of euil men, by giuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to maintaine and profeſſe the truth vnto the death. <hi>To you it is giuen to ſuffer for his ſake</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Phil. 1.29.</note>. In the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will further manifeſt this <hi>deliuerance;</hi> for then all <hi>teares ſhall be wiped away, there ſhall be no more death, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Reue. 21.3.</note>. The diuell, with all his angels and wicked inſtruments, ſhall bee ſent away eternally into hell. <hi>The God of peace ſhall tread Sathan vnder our feete ſhortly</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 16.</note>. Many things might heere be handled, as of the Excellencie of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, farre exceeding that of <hi>Moſes, Deborah, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> and others; of our ſecuritie, who hauing ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, yet take no thought to withſtand them, and ſuch like points: But the chiefe thing obſeruable heere, is <hi>The certainty of the ſaluation of Gods choſen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> If any thing could endanger them and worke their ruine, it muſt be one of theſe foure, Sathan, Sinne, Death, the World; no fift can be thought vpon: But none of theſe foure can. The reaſon is; It was Gods intent, by Chriſt to deliuer them from all theſe: Thinke wee that God did faile in the proſecuting his intent? did he either not follow it, or in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it, did he not accompliſh it? Farre be it from vs ſo to thinke. Hence commeth that boaſting vſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? Who ſhall condemne? Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8.32.33.34.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sathans head broken, ſinne deſtroied, death ſwallowed vp, the world vanquiſhed, the happieſt and moſt abſolute victory that euer was.</p>
            <p>This is a point of much comfort to all the godly.<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Sathan

rageth, ſinne ſtriueth, death looketh terrible, the world op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it ſelfe: fearefull are theſe things at the firſt behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Looke we to <hi>Ieſus the author and finiſher of our faith</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 2.10.</note>: he hath to euery of theſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their mortall wound, and they ſhall neuer preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of his choſen.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 3.8.</note>, Yet, leſt any ſhould abuſe it, remember that one of the enemies is ſinne, and one of the deliuerances from ſinne, is from the dominion thereof. A ſlaue to ſinne, a ſeruant to his owne luſts, he which maketh <hi>a mocke of ſinne</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 14.9.</note>, he that taketh to himſelfe the liberty of groſſe euils, ſuch a one hath no right vnto this comfortable deliuerance; his condemnation (without ſpeedy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) is as ſure, as the ſaluation of the elect is certaine.</p>

            <p>In the former of theſe, two things
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19491:26"/>
muſt bee handled. 1. <hi>That the worke of Redemption by Chriſt, was intended by God, as it were a ſtage, in which the Fulneſſe and euen the riches of his mercy might be ſeene.</hi> 2. A queſtion, how this worke now wrought (as it were) in the worlds laſt quarter, might be ſaid to be a worke of mercy to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who liued in the prime daies of the world, long before Chriſt was exhibited in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>To manifeſt the firſt of theſe two, this firſt is in generall to bee noted, that the Elect of God, which are redeemed by Chriſts precious blood, are called <hi>Veſſels of mercy</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 9.23.</note>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the eternal counſel of God they were choſen to this end, that the Lord might <hi>declare the riches of his glorie,</hi> and that their ſaluation might be to <hi>the praiſe of the glorie of his grace</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note>. The Lord intending a memorable inſtance of his vnſpeakable mercy, choſe ſome in Chriſt, to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from eternall ſlauerie by his death. Secondly it is woorthy the obſeruing, that the whole worke of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called by this one word <hi>Mercy</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.10.</note>. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to which part ſoeuer of it we caſt our eies, we ſhall ſee more than prints and footeſteps of his grace; the whole frame of it, is (as it were) made of mercy. If wee begin at the foundation of all, (Gods eternall election) and paſſe downe along by the period and full point of all (the glory which ſhall be ſhewed heereafter) and aske from what root ech part did ſpring, this one <hi>mercy,</hi> muſt bee the ſum of euery anſwer: There was <hi>mercy</hi> in chuſing; <hi>mercy</hi> in ſending Chriſt; <hi>mercy</hi> in calling vs; <hi>mercy</hi> in iuſtifying vs, and what can it be but <hi>mercy,</hi> that we ſhall be admitted to an <hi>Inheritance immortall and vndefiled</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.4.</note>? <hi>Mercy</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <hi>mercy</hi> the progreſſe, the concluſion <hi>mercy.</hi> In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing heereof the burden of our ſong muſt ſtill bee like that of the Pſalme, <hi>For his mercy endureth for euer</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 136.1. &amp;c.</note>. This very ſame thing, is ſhewed in that parable of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. In the whole paſſage therof, we ſhall ſee nothing but the fruits of exceeding <hi>mercy: He ranne and fell on his necke, he kiſſed him, he commanded to bring foorth the beſt robe, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19491:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to kill the fat calfe, &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Luc. 16.20. &amp;c.</note>: What was heere but <hi>mercy?</hi> The ſame is true in the dealing of God the Father with thoſe to whom hee is reconciled in his Sonne: Chriſt being for them made ſinne, feeles the edge of his iuſtice; but they, being made righteous through Chriſt, enioy the fulneſſe of his mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note>This is, firſt, matter of information and of ſettlement in the truth. For heere we ſee, againſt the Papiſts, that in the whole worke of mans redemption by Chriſt, there is no footing left for humane merit. Light and darknes, God &amp; the diuell are not in a more direct line of oppoſition either to other, than <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>merit:</hi> It is vnpoſſible that theſe two ſhould admit any compoſition. It is ſaid by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that in lower degrees, contraries may haue ſome concurrence: as light and darkneſſe in the twilight: But take two contrarie qualities, and let one of them be in the height and full ſtrength, there is no poſſibilitie of place for the other. So then, ſeeing in the worke of ſaluation, the Lord hath intended to make ſhew, not of ſome parcels (as it were) but of the verie fulneſſe of his <hi>mercy,</hi> there is no more roome for <hi>merit,</hi> than there was for <hi>Dagon</hi> before <hi>the Arke</hi> of <hi>Iehouah</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Sam. 5.3.</note>. I remember what is ſaid of him that went into the <hi>field to gather herbes, hee found a wilde gourd, and ſhred it into the pottage:</hi> But when the pottage came to be taſted, the eaters cried out, <hi>Death is in the pot</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">2. Kin. 4.39.40.</note>. Such cookes the Papiſts are: they take vpon them to make readie a potion of comfort, for a perplexed ſoule; but when they temper with this herbe of <hi>Grace,</hi> the leaues of this wilde gourd of humane <hi>merit,</hi> which neuer grew in the Lords garden, or at leaſt was neuer planted by him, but crept in (as a weed) by the negligence of the dreſſers, they haue giuen occaſion to make the ſame crie, <hi>Death is in the pot,</hi> and with it they haue poiſoned a world of ſoules, and haue dealt as iniuriouſly with the Church of God, as the Philiſtims did with <hi>Izhak,</hi> when they <hi>ſtopped and filled vp with earth all his Welles</hi>

               <note n="y" place="margin">Iob 13.28.</note>. But teach him to build all vpon Gods mercy, labouring that nothing of his owne may be once thought vpon in this buſines, hee ſhall ſtraight ſee ſuch <hi>a breadth and length, depth and height</hi>

The moſt perſons of note vnder the Law, were types of Chriſt, and all their ſacrifices and ceremonies tended to this one thing, to cheriſh in them the hope of the Meſſias; and to acquaint them with the whole myſterie of Redemption, which was wrought by his meanes. There is not one little circumſtance in the carriage of our ſaluation by Chriſt, but the ſame was ſhadowed out in the ancient complements of the Law: Euen <hi>Abraham ſaw the day of Christ</hi>

Now then, looke how the Fathers, ſo long before might haue benefit by his death to come, by the ſame means may we now ſo long after receaue comfort by his death paſt. By faith they beheld Chriſt to be offered, and are now entred into reſt: by faith we may alſo looke backe vpon Chriſt already ſacrificed, and be admitted into the fellowſhip of eternall happineſſe.

            <p>The other thing which God intended to make knowen in the worke of our Redemption, is his <hi>Truth. To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his holy couenant, and the oth &amp;c.</hi> Heere wee muſt treat touching this <hi>Holy Couenant,</hi> what it is, and how it was confirmed by an <hi>Oth:</hi> and then next, how God can bee ſaid to bee mindfull of his <hi>Couenant</hi> and <hi>Oth.</hi> As for the former, we all know the nature of a Couenant. By it heere are meant thoſe Articles of agreement which are betwixt God and man concerning life eternall. The ſubſtance of this Couenant is, <hi>I will be thy God, and thou ſhalt be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> This Couenant is twofold. The one of Works, the condition whereof is, perfect Obedience. The other of grace, of which the condition is Faith <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note>. Theſe two coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are one: they differ in maner of diſpenſation, the one being in types and ſhadowes after a more obſcure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and called <hi>The old Couenant:</hi> the other being more plaine and perſpicuous, deliuered after a new faſhion, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19491:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore called <hi>The New:</hi> But the ſumme of both, was and is, Chriſt Ieſus: <hi>No other foundation can be laid</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11.</note>: and it was euer a trueth, that <hi>God was in Christ, reconciling the world vnto himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19.</note>. Now this couenant is called <hi>a Holy couenant,</hi> becauſe it was made by a holy God, and tended vnto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, both to make Chriſts holineſſe to become ours, and to binde vs to ſhew foorth the fruits of holineſſe in our liues. Touching the confirmation of it by an oth, <hi>(By my ſelfe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I haue ſworne</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 22.16.</note>,) in it, briefly we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the qualitie of the oth: and the reaſon why God ſware. The qualitie of the Oth is, <hi>By himſelfe.</hi> The Lord doeth binde (as it were) his Godhead for the performance of that which he promiſeth, as though hee ſhould ſay, <hi>If this be not ſo, let me be God no more:</hi> Now for the other, it may bee indeed doubted, why God ſhould ſweare, ſeeing his word is certaine in it ſelfe and needs no confirmation: but we muſt know, that God ſware not to win more credit to his promiſe, but he did it for the better confirmation of our faith, <hi>being willing more abundantly to ſhew vnto vs the ſtableneſſe of his Counſell</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now for that, how God can be ſaid to <hi>remember his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant and oth,</hi> ſeeing God cannot forget, thus it muſt bee vnderſtood: The long delaying of the actual performance of the promiſe touching the Meſſias, might giue occaſion to ſome to thinke that God had vtterly forgotten it, and that it was but a verball promiſe without any purpoſe of accompliſhment. But now (ſaith <hi>Zecharie</hi>) hee will fulfill all to the vtmoſt, and by ſo doing make it manifeſt, that whatſoeuer men might ſuppoſe, yet the performance of the Couenant was euer in his minde. The ſenſe then of the whole place is this; that wheras God had freely and of his owne accord made a holie league with his church, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame vpon Chriſt, and binding it (for better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) with an Oth, which notwithſtanding becauſe of the delaies of ſo many yeeres, might ſeeme to bee euen bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in forgetfulneſſe; hee would now make knowne his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19491:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neuer failing faithfulneſſe, and ſhew to the world, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all that he had ſaid, ſhould fall to the ground vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The doctrine here is,<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> 
               <hi>the abſolute and vnchangeable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Gods promiſes.</hi> One end of the incarnation of Chriſt was, that there might in it be an euidence giuen to the world, that the Lord neither could nor would be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of his promiſe. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirme the promiſes made to the fathers</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 15.8</note>. <hi>I will not falſifie my truth, my couenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 89.33.</note>. It was a worthie reſolution of the Prophet, long before Chriſt was borne: <hi>Thou wilt performe thy truth to Iacob, &amp; mercy to Abraham, as thou haſt ſworne to our fathers in old time</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Mica. 7.20.</note>. <hi>God can not lie</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note>, <hi>nor denie himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">2. Tim. 2.13.</note>: <hi>Thou art the ſame</hi> (ſaith the Pſalme <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 102.27.</note>): <hi>I am the Lord, I change not</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Mal. 3.6. <hi>The</hi> 1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note>. This is the reaſon he is called <hi>Iehouah,</hi> becauſe as he giueth <hi>being to all things,</hi> and hath his owne <hi>being</hi> from himſelfe; ſo he makes that to <hi>be</hi> which he hath promiſed.</p>
            <p>Of this there is a double vſe. Firſt, here is much matter of vpholding for the faith of a Chriſtian. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; that is much: he hath bound his promiſe with an oath; this is more. Hee hath <hi>ſent his ſonne in the fulneſſe of time</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note>, <hi>in whom all his promiſes are Yea and Amen</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 1.20.</note>. What can be more abſolute? The faith which is ſtrengthened with this threefolde cord can not eaſily be broken. It is an olde cuſtome of the diuell to lay ſiege to the truth of Gods word: <hi>Yea, hath God indeed ſayd</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note>? So now, the main point that he laboureth in, is, That God will not be ſo good as his word, he will <hi>forget to be mercifull, and his promiſe will faile for euermore</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 77.89.</note>. To put backe this aſſault, remember this one inſtance of the manifeſtation of Chriſt: all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had their reference to him. His birth and ſufferings are left as an vndoubted pledge of the performance of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God hath ſpoken. We may ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>He that gaue vs Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him giue all things
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19491:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note>? So, he that hath performed the promiſe concerning Chriſt, wherein ſhall he faile? He that hath kept his word in this, I will make no queſtion of his truth in any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note>Secondly (for a ſecond vſe) here is matter of very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduertiſement to vs all. Heere is mention made of the couenant of God, of the oath of God, and of the certeintie of both. This couenant conſiſteth of two parts: in the one God bindes himſelfe to vs, to be our <hi>God;</hi> in the other we binde our ſelues to him, to be his <hi>people. I will ſay to them, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Hoſ. 2.23.</note>. His is a couenant of mercy, ours is a couenant of obedience. He promiſeth happineſſe, we holineſſe; he glory, we du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: he hath tied himſelfe by an oath, we haue bound our ſelues by the vow of baptiſme. Will he be mindfull of his couenant, and ſhall we forget ours? Will not he alter, and ſhall we faile? Will not he trifle with vs, and ſhall we dally with him? God forbid. Yet, this faltring in that part of the couenant which concernes vs, is a common euill. The moſt of our liues rather argue a reſolution to breake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, than a purpoſe and endeuour to performe it. <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the Lord</hi> (ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel) I haue fulfilled the commandement of the Lord. But Samuel ſaid, What meaneth then the bleating of the ſheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">1. Sam. 15.13.14.</note>? So, it is like enough, we will be readie to iuſtifie our ſelues; and when we are challenged for breach of promiſe, will be ready to ſay, like the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying Iewes, <hi>Wherein</hi>

            <p>Touching this end, I will ſpeake
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19491:32"/>
firſt, generally; and then, more particularly I will diſcuſſe thoſe things which doe neceſſarily concerne that maine duty, at which God aimed in vouchſafing vs ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance by Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>The general ſumme of this end of our redemption is, that <hi>we being deliuered from our enemies ſhould ſerue God.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe <hi>enemies</hi> who they are, and what is the <hi>deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> from them, I ſhall not neede to ſpeake; theſe things were opened in the 71. <hi>verſ.</hi> The ſenſe and generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the place is this;<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That the purpoſe of God in freeing vs from the ſpirituall bondage in which we were by nature, was, that we ſhould euen conſecrate our ſelues to the glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſeruice of himſelfe.</hi> This point is plaine in the words of this place, and eaſily to be further manifeſted by the Scripture. <hi>Being made free from ſinne, ye are made the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 6.18.</note>; that is, ſeeing the Lord hath dealt thus gratiouſly with you, to reſcue you by the death of Chriſt from the ſlauerie of ſinne, this is that which is now expected of you, euen that you ſhould deuote your ſelues to the practiſe of righteouſneſſe, being hencefoorth as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in good ſeruices, as yee haue formerly beene earneſt and eager in fulfilling your own luſts, and in glutting your ſelues with the pleaſures of ſinne. Like to this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the ſame Apoſtle elſwhere in the ſame Epiſtle: <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you giue vp your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note>. He perſwades vnto a godly life by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs the mercies of God. Now this kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were of no force, were it not for this, namely, that the drift of all Gods mercy vnto vs in Chriſt, is, the drawing and recouering of vs from the ſeruice of Sathan, vnto the obedience and ſeruice of himſelfe: Such is that ſpeech of his in another place: <hi>Yee are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God, &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.</note>, as if hee had ſaid, God hath redeemed you, therefore it ſtandeth with equitie, and it is agreeing to his purpoſe and meaning, that you ſhould ſerue him. Excellent is that place to <hi>Titus; The grace of God &amp;c. hath
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19491:32"/>
appeared, and teacheth vs, that we ſhould denie vngodlineſſe, &amp;c. and that we ſhould liue ſoberly &amp;c. in this preſent world</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Tit. 2.11.12.</note>. The meaning is, that the doctrine of the Goſpell (the ſum whereof is, Redemption in and by Chriſt) is preached publikely vnto all, but not to encourage them to continue in ſinne, but to vrge them to lay aſide profaneneſſe, and to renounce their owne luſts, and to haue their fruit in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as they hope to haue their end, eternall life. For (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Chriſt gaue not himſelfe for vs,</hi> that wee ſhould the more boldly giue the raines to our owne luſts, but that we ſhould <hi>be zealous of good works</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note>. To theſe we may ioyne that of S. <hi>Peter: Paſſe the time of your dwelling heere in feare, knowing that wee were not redeemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, &amp;c. but with the precious blood of Christ</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.17.18.19.</note>. There he vſeth the price of redemption as a ſpecial motiue to a religious life, inaſmuch alſo as the drift thereof was to free vs from <hi>our vaine conuerſation.</hi> Many particulars of this kind might be heaped vp: I will conclude this enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of places with the ſaying of <hi>Dauid; Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deliuered my ſoule from death, and alſo my feete from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that I may walke before God in the light of the liuing</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 56.13.</note>. He makes the end of all the deliuerances which God had vouchſafed him, to be this one thing, that he might ſpend his daies in a ſincere courſe in the ſight of God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is a matter of greate equitie. <hi>Who planteth a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and eateth not of the fruit thereof</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.7.</note>? And ſo; who will pay a price of Redemption for him, by whom he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no ſeruice? Gods wee are by the right of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Yee are not your owne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.19</note>): we are bought with a price for his vſe, therefore all which we can doe, is to be diuerted to his glorie.</p>
            <p>Heereby it appeareth that the caſe is not ſo as the moſt ſuppoſe: The Goſpell is no doctrine of carnall libertie,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> as though becauſe of the abundance of mercy, and in reſpect that Chriſt hath performed ſufficient for the preſenting of vs without fault in Gods ſight, and for the acquiting vs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19491:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the guilt of al our ſins, be they neuer ſo many or ſo great, therefore it might be lawfull for vs to liue after our owne will, and to giue liberty to our owne inordinate affections. No: the doctrine of the Goſpell tieth vs to as ſtrict termes of obedience, as the law. There is not any one holy dutie which in the Scripture God requireth of a Chriſtian, from which the freedome of our being iuſtified by the grace of Chriſt, doeth giue vs any colour of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Fit to this purpoſe is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had largely diſputed of our free iuſtification by Chriſt, &amp; had proued that the works of the Law are of no force to deſerue ſaluation; <hi>Doe wee then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make the Law of none effect through Faith?</hi> For ſo it might ſeeme to bee a matter indifferent whether wee doe well or no, and that the doctrine which hee had taught being true, there is no vſe of the Morall Law. <hi>God forbid</hi> (anſwereth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>yea we eſtabliſh the Law</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note>. The doctrine of grace is ſo farre from ouerthrowing the Law, that it bindes all which hope to bee ſaued to a more ſtrait obedience: good works are <hi>ordeined</hi> for them <hi>to walke in</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ephe. 2.10.</note>, and God hath therefore called them vnto grace, that he might be glorified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eir pure conuerſation. Let all profane ones conſider this, all deſpiſers of good things, ſwearers, Sabbath-breakers, wantons, drunkards, Libertines, &amp;c. Such (ſome of them) doe pretend a faith in Chriſt, they will ſay they hope they are redeemed by him, and looke to be ſaued by his death. I aske of thee, who ſo hopeſt and yet liueſt in the ſeruice of the diuell, and in bondage to thine owne luſts, what thinkeſt thou? Doeſt thou beleeue that God did therefore ſend Chriſt, or, that Chriſt did therefore ſhed his precious bloud, that men might take libertie thereby to enter into all maner of exceſſe? Did hee therefore raiſe vp an horne of ſaluation, that vnder hope thereof men might lay ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to iniquitie, and then ſalue vp all with this, <hi>I beleeue in Chriſt, I know mine owne works cannot ſaue mee, &amp;c.</hi> God forbid, that any man ſhould ſo imagine. It is plaine againſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19491:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Scripture, and directly contrarie to the purpoſe of God in the worke of mans Redemption. Marke this place: God hath <hi>viſited, redeemed, raiſed vp a horne of ſaluation, &amp;c.</hi> not to eſtabliſh ſinne, but to diſſolue ſinne, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vs from our obedience, but to binde vs vnto dutie. Therefore, either bee ſure that thy ſetled reſolution and purpoſe is, to mortifie and ſubdue thine owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſacrifice euen thy ſweeteſt and beſt pleaſing ſinnes vnto God, and to limit thy ſelfe by all meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of Chriſtian obedience, or els thou art one of thoſe, of whom S. <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeakes, which <hi>art of old ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to condemnation</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Iude 4.</note>; the benefit of redemption belongeth not to thee, thy <hi>damnation ſleepeth not,</hi> and thy <hi>iudgement long agone is not farre off</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.3.</note>. Thus much in generall touching the end of our redemption, to <hi>ſerue God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now follow the particulars appertaining to it, and they are theſe. 1. The partie from whom the power and grace to doe this, (to wit, to ſerue and glorifie God) muſt bee looked for; <hi>That he would grant vs.</hi> 2. The maner of ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; <hi>without feare.</hi> 3. The time to which the performance of this duty is tied; <hi>All the daies of our life.</hi> 4. The ſpecial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherin it ſtands: <hi>holineſſe and righteouſnes.</hi> 5. The trial of the truth of theſe duties: <hi>before him.</hi> Of theſe in their courſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt touching the party from whom the power to ſerue God muſt be expected: <hi>That he would grant vnto vs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zacharie.</hi>) This is a chiefe difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel. The Law commandeth good things, but ſheweth no meanes of doing them. The Goſpell doth not onely enioyne things right, but declareth alſo, how and whence that may bee ſupplied which is wanting in vs. Therefore <hi>Zacharie</hi> doeth not onely manifeſt the drift and intent of God in redeeming vs, (namely, that wee ſhould <hi>ſerue</hi> him) but doeth alſo point his finger to the fountaine, and teacheth vs who it is, that will enable vs to doe it. And indeed this is a part of the Couenant of grace,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That as God will expect ſeruice at our hands, ſo he will make vs able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19491:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that acceptable ſeruice which hee requireth.</hi> In the handling of which doctrine, I will declare two things. 1. That in vs there is no ſuch power. 2. That God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in thoſe whom he hath choſen. The former of theſe is apparent out of the manifeſt teſtimonies of the Scripture. <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of mans hart are only euil continually</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note>. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing as of our ſelues</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 3.5.</note>. <hi>Without me you can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note>. Now, <hi>who can bring a cleane thing out of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 7.16.</note>? There is nothing but crookedneſſe in our nature, and how is it poſſible that any good thing ſhould come there from? The ſecond branch, touching the ſupplie from God of that which is wanting in vs, is very cleere. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord, him will hee teach the way that hee ſhall chuſe</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſa. 25.12.</note>; <hi>Thou ſhalt walke ſafely by the way, and thy feet ſhal not ſtumble</hi>

               <note n="e" place="margin">Ezec. 36.27.</note>. Theſe places ſhew how that the Lord will furniſh his redeemed with ſuch a meaſure of grace, as that they ſhall walke in ſuch a way, and runne ſuch a courſe as ſhall bee pleaſing and acceptable to himſelfe. The order and maner of the Lords bringing this to paſſe in them is this: Firſt, becauſe the heart is the fountaine of all our actions, therefore Gods firſt worke in them, is, to <hi>put a new ſpirit into their bowels,</hi> and, <hi>to take the ſtonie hart out of their bodies, and to giue them a heart of fleſh</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ezec. 11.19.</note>, that is, to remooue their naturall vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and to make their hearts, more inclinable and pliable vnto good. Secondly, he <hi>putteth his Law in their inward parts, and writeth it there</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 31.33.</note>, he planteth in them the true ſauing knowledge, he <hi>openeth their harts</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 16.14.</note>, making them to conceaue and vnderſtand it, hee cauſeth them to loue it, and to delight in it, he kindleth in them a deſire to practiſe it, and to walke in all holy obedience to it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee furniſheth them with the aſſiſtance of a ſecret dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, a <hi>word behinde them, ſaying to them: This is the way, walke in it</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iſay 30.21.</note>; and thus he <hi>keepeth their feet</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Sam. 2.9.</note>, <hi>and guides them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19491:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the way</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſa. 25.9.</note>. Fourthly, hee <hi>filleth them with the fruits of righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note>, that is, hee enableth them to bring foorth that good into outward act, the knowledge whereof is ſeated in their hearts; that ſo they may not bee <hi>idle nor vnfruitfull</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">2. Pet. 1.8.</note>, but may <hi>adorne the doctrine of God their Sauiour in all things</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 2.10.</note>. Laſtly, hee doth not ſo leaue them, but the hand of his mercy is ſtilll ſtretched out, to <hi>ſtabliſh them in euery word and good worke</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.17.</note>, to confirme them and to <hi>make them perfit</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 13.21.</note>, that ſo they may hold out, and may not be <hi>wearie of well doing</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.13.</note>, but that the yoke of Chriſt may <hi>become eaſie</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Math. 11.30.</note> vnto them, and the Chriſtian life may not ſeeme (as it doeth to the wicked) burdenſome and vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Thus it is manifeſt, that ſerue the Lord of our ſelues we cannot; and withall, that God hath euen tied himſelfe by promiſe to enable his ſeruants thereunto.</p>

            <p>The next point is the maner of doing this duty: (<hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare.)</hi> This place muſt firſt be examined, becauſe it may ſeeme contrary to another place, which biddeth vs <hi>to ſerue the Lord with feare</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note>. We muſt therfore learne to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh: There is a helliſh feare, and there is a holy feare, a ſlauiſh feare, and a ſonlike feare. The former of theſe is called by S. <hi>Paul, the ſpirit of bondage</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note>. It is ſuch as ſlaues haue in reſpect of thoſe to whom they are in bondage: A kind of reſpect they haue to thoſe in whoſe power they are, they doe that which is commanded them, but they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19491:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither haue loue to their commanders, nor take any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that which is enioyned them: that which they doe, they doe by enforcement, and in feare of the whip. Such is the feare of God in reprobates: ſometimes they are ſtricken with a kind of awe of Gods maieſtie, and doe euen tremble at his iudgements, and (it may be) doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is required, but their obedience proceedeth not out of any loue to God, or out of any truth of affection to that which is performed, but only out of conſtraint. Thus did Cain <hi>cast downe his countenance</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 4.6.</note>, Eſau <hi>weepe</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 27.38.</note>, Pharaoh <hi>let the people goe</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Exo. 12 31.</note>, Ahab <hi>humble himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">1. King. 21.27.</note>, Iudas <hi>repent</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Math. 27.3.</note>. None of theſe was truly grieued for his offence, or ſory that God was diſpleaſed: They had an apprehenſion of <hi>the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.11.</note>, and that wrung from them ſomething, in which otherwiſe of themſelues they tooke no delight. Now the other feare is called the <hi>ſpirit of adoption</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note>, and it is a feare to offend, riſing out of the apprehenſion and feeling of Gods loue: as, when the experience which I haue had in my ſelfe of Gods gracious dealing with mee, maketh mee to entertaine a feare leſt I ſhould abuſe his loue, and doe ought that might diſpleaſe his maieſtie. This kind of feare may be where there is the greateſt and firmeſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue loue: as betwixt the father and ſonne; the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife: <hi>Let the wife ſee that ſhe feare her huſband,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ephe. 5.33.</note>. This diſtinction of feare, being rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it will be eaſie to reconcile theſe places. <hi>Serue the Lord with feare</hi> ſaith Dauid: that is, conſider you the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God, what he is in himſelfe, and what he is to you, and ſo let your hearts ſtand in awe of him, and be you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to diſpleaſe him. Againe, the end of our redemption is, that we ſhould <hi>ſerue God without feare,</hi> ſaith Zachary: This is his meaning; Wheras the face of God, is naturally a terror vnto vs, euen as the face of a Iudge is to a theefe, and whereas that which we doe is ſo full of maimes and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, that we can haue no courage to preſent it vnto God, nor hope that he will accept it, this is the end of our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19491:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
redemption, that being certainly perſwaded of the fauour of God in Chriſt, and of remiſſion of ſinnes by him, all this feare may be quite remoued, and we may boldly come to the throne of grace, and comfortably aſſure our ſelues, that God for Chriſt will accept, euen the imperfect and ſcant meaſure of our obedience. This is the true ſenſe of the place, this is the feare, in the freedome from which ſtandeth the true ſeruice of God. So that now this is the doctrine;<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That till the mind and conſcience of a Chriſtian be quieted and pacified by the knowledge of ones perſonall acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before God by Chriſt, a man cannot truly ſerue God, nor yeeld vnto him that obedience which he ought.</hi> This is plaine out of the place: the true maner of ſeruing God is <hi>without feare,</hi> that is, without aſtoniſhment and ſuſpenſe of mind how God will accept that which we doe. Now this feare cannot be baniſhed, but by the comfortable apprehenſion of a diſcharge by Chriſt, therefore without this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſion, no man can ſerue and obey God as he ought to doe. Theſe things are all manifeſt. The reaſon alſo of the doctrine is apparent thus: As often as I recount with my ſelfe the ſeuerity and iuſtice of God, how that he cannot abide iniquity, and is in his wrath a <hi>conſuming fire</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note>, and doe conſider withall, how full of corruption my heart is, and how farre ſhort the beſt I can doe, comes of that which is required, what heart ſhall I haue to tender my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto him, vnleſſe I be ſomeway aſſured that my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is accepted in Chriſt, and that Gods iuſt diſpleaſure is allaied towards mee for his ſake, ſo that my ſcant perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances ſhall be ſhrouded vnder his moſt abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit obedience? Hence is that ſaying of Dauid: <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou maiſt be feared</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 130.4.</note>. It is the hope and apprehenſion of mercy which encourageth to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Seeing we haue theſe promiſes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let vs cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe, &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">2. Cor. 7.1.</note>. See what <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth vpon the promiſes of mercy which God hath made. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth in one place, that <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19491:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faith is ſinne</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note>, meaning that whatſoeuer is offered to God, which proceedeth not from faith, the ſame is a ſinne. In another place he ſaith, that <hi>by faith</hi> our conſciences haue <hi>peace with God</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note>. Both the places put together do ſhew thus much, that vntill the conſcience bee pacified by the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of reconciliation with God by Chriſt, nothing that is done can finde acceptance with the Lord. The order of the words touching <hi>Habel,</hi> is woorth the noting; <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Habel, and to his offring</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note>: Firſt, to <hi>Habel,</hi> then to his offring. So that till I know that God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my perſon, I can haue no hope that he will reſpect my ſeruice.</p>
            <p>By this it is plaine, firſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> that it is vnpoſſible for a Papiſt rightly to ſerue God, or to yeeld vnto him any true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This wil be thought a hard cenſure, eſpecially touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe which ſeeme ſo deuout and make ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of good works: But it is eaſily iuſtified by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this place. God is not rightly ſerued vnleſſe it be without feare, without that ſlauiſh awe, which ariſeth out of the not knowing a mans own particular reconciliation with God. Now it is certaine, that Papiſts do ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, that it is vnpoſſible for a man by an ordinary faith to bee aſſured of Gods fauour. By the Decrees of the Councell of Trent, a man muſt doubt of his ſaluation as long as he liueth in this world <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; Can.</hi> 13.16.</note>: ſo that indeed a Papiſt can neuer attaine to any true peace of conſcience by his owne doctrine: If he keepe himſelfe to it, he muſt reſolue while he liueth to be in ſuſpenſe and vncertaine of Gods fauour: What a racke is this to a mans conſcience, to bee taught that he can neuer bee ſure in this World that his ſins are pardoned, and that God is reconciled to him in Chriſt Ieſus? What cheerefulneſſe or boldneſſe can a man haue to ſerue God, when it is taught that there is no poſſibilitie for him to be aſſured in his ſoule that God in Chriſt will accept his ſeruice and forgiue his weakneſſes? Let this be a rule to vs to iudge of Poperie: it is a deſperate comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19491:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doctrine. Chriſt came into the world to free vs from this ſeruile feare, and to fill our hearts with cheerefulneſſe, by ſhewing vnto vs Gods louing countenance: Poperie holdeth vs in ſuſpence, and laboureth to vphold that feare which is the very direct enemie to true obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note>Secondly, this maketh alſo againſt the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which (in this point) is the ſame with the Papiſts. The moſt doe talke (I know not what) of ſeruing God, and profeſſe to do it euerie day: but if it be asked what ground they haue of peace with God by Chriſt, this will be found to bee a verie ſtrange demand, and they will not know what to anſwer: Securitie they haue enough, but, what true peace of conſcience is, they vnderſtand not. Well may they ſeeme to be without feare in regard of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brutiſhneſſe: but let their conſciences be touched and awaked, by ſome croſſe, or iudgement, or by deaths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching, then this ſeruile feare, this diſmall horror of heart will ſoone appeare, and it will bee a hard matter to comfort them. Know wee therefore, that vntill we labour to know our owne particular reconciliation with God by Chriſt, and to that end reuerence the ordinance of God (the Word and Sacraments, which ſerue to no other vſe but to applie Chriſt to our ſoules) careleſſe we may be, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in our dregges wee may bee, benummed and ſenſleſſe wee may be; but true peace of conſcience wee can neuer haue, neither can any ſeruice come from vs which ſhall be pleaſing and acceptable vnto God: vnleſſe my heart can witneſſe with me, that I ſerue and obey God cheerefully, and with a free ſpirit, knowing that God for Chriſt hath and doth accept me, and that my weake ſeruices ſhall bee fauourably looked vpon, God meaſuring them rather by the ſinceritie of my affection, than by the meaſure of my performance, I can not ſay that I ſerue God; that which I do, commeth from the ſpirit of bondage, and God eſteemes it not.</p>

That this life is the time of our ſeruing God. 2. That it muſt not bee done in ſome part, but in all the daies of our life.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, this is the doctrine;<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That the time of our liuing here in the world, is the alone time, in which thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be done which ought to be performed by vs in token of thankefulneſſe to God for our redemption, and in respect of the hope which we haue of life eternall.</hi> This plainly followeth hence: for, if the queſtion be, when and at what time the duty of ſeruing God (which is the end of our redemption) muſt be done; the anſwer is, it muſt be done in the <hi>daies of our life,</hi> while we liue heere, or not at all. This is agreeing to the Scriptures in other places. <hi>While we haue time let vs doe good &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>. that is, while we liue here, for when that time is gone, we haue no further opportunity. <hi>In this preſent world,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle elſwhere <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note>; <hi>The time of our dwelling heere,</hi> ſaith Peter <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.17.</note>; <hi>During my life,</hi> ſaith Dauid <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 116.2.</note>. <hi>I haue finiſhed my courſe,</hi> ſaid Paul, when he was neere his death <note n="g" place="margin">2.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19491:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
performed. Thus all is confined to the compaſſe of this preſent life. <hi>After death commeth the iudgement</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note>: then is a time of reckning, not of practiſe. Beſides, death being come, the time of grace is expired, the miniſtry of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation ceaſeth; therefore <hi>now is the accepted time, behold now the day of ſaluation,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 6.2. <hi>The</hi> 1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>This ſerueth firſt, to batter downe the wals of the Popes ſuppoſed purgatorie: the ground whereof is this, that there is a place for repentance after this life, and that as ſome, which are perfit Chriſtians, goe directly after death to heauen, and others, which are extreamely wicked, go ſtraight to hell; ſo there are a middle kind, who hauing not perfited their obedience in this world, nor made full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all their ſinnes, muſt ſtay by the way, in a place of torment, where the reliques of ſin muſt be purged out, and the full ſumme of their duty made vp before they can be admitted into heauen. This is held as an article of faith, and they are ſaid to be certainly damned ſo many as doe not beleeue it <note n="k" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de purg. ca. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note>. Indeed Papiſts haue reaſon to maintaine it, it is a fire which hath well heated the Popes kitching, and the conceit and feare of it, together with an opinion that the offerings of Prieſts can helpe to ſhorten a mans time in it, hath brought them in no ſmall reuenue: they may truly ſay, that <hi>by this craft they haue their goods</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 19.25.</note>. Now the opinion is plainly confuted by this place. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is required of vs, either toward God, or toward man, is to be done in <hi>the daies of our life,</hi> or neuer. The dead in <hi>the Lord, doe rest from their labours</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Reu. 14.13.</note>: This could not be true, if they were either buſied in doing good workes for the getting to heauen, or were tormented in fire. They ſweat much to make good this fancie; but in vaine: ſure we are, the Scripture maketh mention of two only places, for the dead <note n="n" place="margin">Luc. 16.22.23.</note>: neither was there in Moſes law appointed any ſacrifice on the behalfe of the dead. The thing it ſelfe came firſt from the heathen, &amp; was vnknowen to the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Councell of Florence <note n="o" place="margin">Anno Dom. <hi>1439.</hi>
               </note>: and therefore though they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19491:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
threaten the blacke curſe to thoſe that denie it, yet let vs not feare it; <hi>the curſe that is cauſleſſe ſhall not come</hi>

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, this maketh againſt thoſe who are of that ſwiniſh diſpoſition, that they neuer thinke vpon doing good vntill they die; while they liue, they rake, and catch, and extort, and oppreſſe: A man may as ſoone wring water out of a flint, as draw ought from them to a good purpoſe; then they grumble like <hi>Nabal, ſhall I take my bread &amp;c. and giue it to men, whom I knowe not whence they bee</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Sam. 25.11.</note>? But when they come to the knife, and die they muſt and leaue their goods behind them, then (it may be) ſhall ſome drop or two be giuen to the poore, or to ſome good ſeruice. I doe not condemne it if any man by will bequeath ought to the Church or poore: this I condemne, when ſuch things are neuer done tell then: It is an argument, that that which is then done, is but a formall and extorted beneuolence. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall; men therein will doe as others doe: Extorted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is done moſt commonly to ſtop the mouth of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing conſcience. Remember we therefore, that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which we owe to God, or to man for Gods ſake, reacheth it ſelfe to the whole life, and is not to be reſtrained to the laſt act. That knowledge which wee will learne, and that good which we will doe, let vs applie it now: It is a miſerable thing when men muſt be catechized in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and muſt firſt begin to exerciſe charity, when they are going to appeare before God to giue account of their life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Vſe.</note> this doth preſſe a kind of haſtning in the duties of godlineſſe without delaying or putting off. For marke how the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh. He ſaith, that the life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is our only time of well doing: but how doth he define life? not by moneths or yeeres, but by daies, which is alſo the vſuall maner of the Scripture <note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 47.9. Pſal. 90.9.12.</note>. This ſpeech argueth the ſhortneſſe of our life, being nothing but a compoſition of a few daies; which how ſoone they may be ſwallowed vp, by that long night of death, we cannot tell. This ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19491:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make vs <hi>to make haſte</hi> with Dauid <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 119.60.</note>, <hi>and to worke while it is day</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 9.4.</note>. It was the very thing intended by Moſes in that ſute of his, <hi>Teach vs to number our daies &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 90.12.</note>, that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs (O Lord) ſo to ſumme vp the time of our life, that conſidering the ſhortneſſe of it, we may learne this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to doe that firſt which moſt concerns vs, ſo that if by the ſudden comming of death, any thing for lacke of time be left vnperformed, it may not be that, the not doing whereof will be the vndoing of our ſoules. Memorable is the ſpeech of Iſaak: <hi>Behold I am now old, and know not the day of my death, wherfore now &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 27.2.3.</note>: as if he had ſaid; There is a thing to be done, which muſt be done before I die, and I know, that as the daies of my life are but few, ſo the greateſt part of them are gone and paſt, therefore that which I intended I will haſten to doe it: ſo ſhould euerie Chriſtian reaſon w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>h himſelfe; My time is ſhort, my life a ſpan, my daies nor many, therefore Lord frame my heart, that whileſt it is called <hi>to day</hi> I may turne to thee, and ſeeke thy fauour. This care is a chiefe difference betwixt the godly and the wicked: For they argue cleane contrarie, <hi>Let vs eat and drinke, tomorrow we ſhall die</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Iſay 22.13.</note>: Therein they imitate their father the Diuell; for euen of the ſame humor is he: <hi>He hath great wrath, knowing that he hath but a ſhort time</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Reu. 12.12.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point now followeth. For ſo Zachary teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that as God is to be ſerued in our life (which is the more generall point), ſo it muſt be all <hi>the daies of our life.</hi> Here come to be opened two doctrines: 1 That religion is to be practiſed euery day. 2. That it is to be practiſed to the end of our daies. The former of theſe requireth aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and dailineſſe; The latter perpetuity and laſtingneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I will bleſſe thee daily</hi> (ſaith Dauid) <hi>and praiſe thy name for euer</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 145.2.</note>: That ſpeech may be in ſtead of a commentarie to this place. I will ſpeake of both ſeuerally. The former of the two doctrines is;<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>

euery action of the day muſt be a witneſſe of his care to approue himſelfe in all holy conuerſation vnto God. It will not be hard to proue this by the Scripture; namely that a godly life is to be brought into euery daies practiſe. <hi>We muſt henceforth liue as much time as remaineth in the fleſh, not after the luſts of men</hi>

And if it were not ſo, why ſhould God be ſo carefull in the Scripture to giue ſuch directions for euery ſpecialty that can be incident to any day; as, apparrell, meat, calling, companie, ſpeech, ſolitarineſſe, recreation, health, ſicknes, proſperity, croſſes, friends &amp;c? whatſoeuer occaſion may at any time take vp a man in any part of the day, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giueth a direction for it, becauſe a man is bound to make conſcience of the practiſe of religion in euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Now a double reaſon there is for this doctrine. Firſt, Gods <hi>compaſſions are renued euery morning</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lam. 3.23.</note>, and he <hi>ladeth vs dayly with benefits</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 68.19.</note>. Now ſith there is no ſlacking of Gods kindneſſe, why ſhould there be any intermiſſion of our dutie? Secondly, Satan <hi>goeth about, ſeeking to deuoure</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.8.</note>: when a man beginneth to be a little ſecure, and to giue the raines a little to his owne heart to wander after it owne waies, then taketh he his aduantage; and the ſoule being by ſome intermiſſion of a godly care thus (as it were) let looſe, doth quickly fall into his ſnares.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note>The firſt vſe of this doctrine is, to remoue two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are common in the world touching religion: The one is, that it is an eaſie matter to be a Chriſtian, a thing of no great paines to be religious; ſome generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſome ſuperficiall good meanings, ſome formall ſhews, ſome deuotion now and then by fits, ſome few actions of charity; this is enough to ſaluation. Hence commeth our common ſecurity: Moiling and droiling there is for the world without meaſure: To ſome carnall and carking hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, the day is not long enough, the weeke is too ſhort, euen ſome of Gods day muſt be borrowed for earthly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Godlineſſe is followed but at leaſure times: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen we ſuppoſe will come of it ſelfe without ſeeking. How many daies paſſe ouer vs in a yere, in which matters of the ſoule are not once thought vpon! But how much are wee heerein deceiued? Religion is a taske for euery day: Hee that doeth not make conſcience euery day to looke to his Religion, to profit in his Religion, and to ſhew foorth the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19491:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fruits of his Religion, that hee may comfortably at night ſay, he is ſo much neerer his iourneies end to heauen, than hee was at his firſt ſetting out in the morning; that mans Religion is not as it ought: and he which thinketh to come to heauen by this idle and negligent courſe, ſhall be called <hi>the leaſt in the kingdome of God</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Matt. 5.19.</note>. The ſecond opinion is, that if there bee ſome ſhew of deuotion and care to ſerue God on the Sabbath day, then vpon other daies men may be left free to themſelues, and may take a little more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be ſecure. If matters of godlineſſe be baniſhed from their thoughts, and tongues, and liues, all the whole weeke long, they thinke it to be no great offence: This opinion is ouerthrowen by this place. Wee were redeemed to ſerue God euery day: Though the Sabbath bee to be imploied more eſpecially (God then vouchſafing more plentifull helpes to godlineſſe) yet all euill is to bee auoided euerie day, and all ſuch good is to be done, as in our callings and liues we ſhall be occaſioned: Endeuour wee muſt to walke in the ſanctification of our hearts, and innocency of life in other daies, as well as on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this muſt be a motiue to vs, euery day,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> euen at our firſt awaking, to deuote and conſecrate our ſelues to the Lord, and to arme our ſelues with a holy reſolution to ſtriue againſt ſinne: This will be a matter of no little bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: For by this meanes God will enable vs to <hi>be blameleſſe and pure, &amp; without rebuke</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note>, and we ſhall be <hi>kept from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note>. The want heereof draweth manie of Gods children ſometimes into great inconueniences, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as, not conſidering the ſlippery path which they walke in heere in the world, and being without feare of their owne frailtie, they doe not couenant with themſelues to bee very watchfull, and to commit their way vnto the Lord, and to ſtand vpon their guard againſt euerie ſinne: We haue an example of this in <hi>Peter:</hi> Doubtleſſe hee had no ſetled purpoſe to denie his Maſter: yet to what a caſe did his owne raſhneſſe bring him, while he did not ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19491:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
caſt with himſelfe what danger might ariſe, by the place and perſons, neither yet waighed his own weakneſſe, how eaſily he might be ſnared, hauing no warrant to bee there. This draweth many into ill company, to ſwearing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, &amp;c. I will not ſay, that theſe euils in ſome do alwaies proceed from a purpoſe ſo to do; but rather from the want of a purpoſe to withſtand them, and to giue vp themſelues vnto God. I would this were written in euerie ones heart, that euery day muſt be conſecrate to God, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day muſt be a holy day to a Chriſtian, though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ſenſe in reſpect of ceſſation from labour, yet in reſpect of watching and ſtriuing againſt ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Vſe.</note>Thirdly, if euery day muſt be giuen to God, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe which ſpend ſo many whole daies in the ſeruice of Sathan? whole daies (I ſay) or the better part of the day, in drinking and reuelling, in ſports, in pranking vp themſelues, in plotting to defraud, reuenge, and eat out others: How doe theſe conſecrate their daies to God? What religion or godlineſſe is in theſe faſhions? When men make euery day either for vaine pleaſure, or ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or Epicuriſme, or worldly benefit, what is become of Gods part? Thinke vpon it: I doubt not, but the ſerious thinking vpon this, that God challengeth euery day, will reforme many corruptions.

               <note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>The doctrine then is this; <hi>That as we muſt make conſcience of diligence in good duties for the preſent time, ſo we muſt haue a care of continuance and perſeuerance alſo.

            <p>The fourth generall point in this paſſage of ſpeech, is, what be the ſpecial duties in which this our <hi>ſeruing</hi> of God ſtands: <hi>In holineſſe and righteouſneſſe.</hi> Theſe two words anſwer to the two tables of the morall law. By <hi>holineſſe</hi> are vnderſtood thoſe duties which are owing immediately from vs vnto God; and are ſet downe in the foure firſt commandements: namely; a <hi>holy</hi> regard to the truth and maieſtie of his Godhead, in the firſt commandement: a <hi>holy</hi> maner of worſhipping him according to his will, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: a <hi>holy</hi> vſage of his name, in the third: a <hi>holy</hi> keeping of his <hi>ſabbath,</hi> in the fourth. By <hi>righteouſnes</hi> are meant thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19491:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duties which we owe to our neighbor; of all which the ſumme is, to giue to euery one his due: to wrong no man in his honor, or in that precedence which God hath giuen him, in the fift precept: nor in his life, in the ſixt: nor in his chaſtity, in the ſeuenth: nor in his goods, in the eight: nor in his good name, in the ninth: nor to entertaine a thought which may draw to any of theſe breaches, in the tenth: ſo that now our obedience and ſeruice of God ſtands not in following our owne courſes, but in making conſcience to frame our ſelues to that which the Lord commends vnto vs, to be performed either to himſelfe, or to others. Heere is a large field to enter into, but I will abridge that plentifull matter which offereth it ſelfe vnto mee, as much as I can. Two ſpeciall points are heere taught vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>The firſt is; <hi>That true religion ſtands not in a verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or informall ſhewes, but in action, &amp; in the doing of that which God requireth.</hi> It is plaine heere: For heere parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duties are deſigned, in the practiſe whereof true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlineſſe doth conſiſt. In the Scripture, <hi>doing</hi> and practiſe are ſtill vrged. <hi>Hearken to the lawes which I teach you to doe</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 4.1.</note>: <hi>Heare the lawes &amp;c. that ye may take heed to obſerue them.</hi>

If it were not ſo, it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be religious, it were no great thing to be godly: To profeſſe is nothing, to talke and ſpeake of religion, and to make a ſhew is a matter ſoone done, the verieſt Atheiſt may goe ſo farre: doing is the triall, the fruits of <hi>holineſſe and righteouſneſſe</hi> doe ſhew a man to be a Chriſtian.</p>

               <note n="e" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.17.</note>. The other doctrine collected hence, is; <hi>That in the practiſe of religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The 5. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>there muſt be a ioyning together of theſe two, holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; our holy cariage towards God, and our vpright demeanor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi> It is not ſaid heere, <hi>holineſſe</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> as though either might ſerue, but <hi>holineſſe and righteouſneſſe,</hi> both together.

               <note n="f" place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note>. Theſe are two maine parts of the image of God: <hi>Righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note>; neither can we aſſure our ſelues that we are truely regenerate, vnleſſe we find in ourſelues a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of both. It is abſurd to be reſpectiue towards men, and to neglect that duty which we owe to God: It is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall to make ſhew of deuotion to God, and to haue no regard how we liue in reſpect of men: But, to be carefull in the knowledge and ſeruice of God, and fruitfull in the duties of equity and euenneſſe amongſt men, this is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is the whole duty of man.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is very neceſſarie, becauſe,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> the renting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19491:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſunder of theſe two, <hi>holineſſe and righteouſneſſe,</hi> is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon euill of thoſe which make a profeſſion of religion. Some there are, who in the outward exerciſes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are very diligent, in repairing to the congregation, in hearing, in communicating, in refraining from open miſorders on the ſabbath day: but looke on them in thoſe things which concerne men, there you ſhall find them exceeding faulty; proud, diſdainfull, malicious, reuengeful, cruell, oppreſſing, all for themſelues, without reſpect to others: Others there are which ſhew a kind of ciuility in outward faſhion to the world; quiet they be and peaceable, obſeruing a kind of truth and equity in their dealings, and ſo gaine a name and an opinion of honeſt men; yet haue no regard to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of piety, more than for outward forme, deſpiſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, baſely eſteeme the publike miniſtry, make no reckoning of the ſabbath. Both theſe ſorts come ſhort, and continuing as they are can neuer be ſaued. Remember then, to ioyne both together, <hi>holineſſe</hi> towards God, <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> towards men: Art thou a louer to heare, a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the publike exerciſes of religion? thou doſt well: ſee thou make conſcience alſo of equity amongſt men, els all thy deuotion is but hypocriſie. Art thou a man of ciuill faſhion, that pretendeſt to giue euery man his owne? ſee thou ſeaſon thy cariage to men, with knowledge and zeale in the matters of God, els thy ciuilitie is but formalitie: and both the former with his vnrighteous <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and thou, with thine vnholy <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſhall be cut off from hauing any inheritance in the kingdome of Chriſt and of God.</p>
            <p>The fift and laſt point, according to the order firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is the triall of the truth of all theſe duties, in thoſe words, <hi>before him:</hi> whereby is meant ſuch <hi>holineſſe</hi> and ſuch <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> which is framed, not barely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men,<note place="margin">The <hi>6.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> but to pleaſe God: where we are taught; <hi>That if we would be religious indeed, we muſt not looke ſo much how to make a ſhew and to be ſomething in appearance and opinion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19491:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before men, as how to approue our ſelues by truth and ſincerity of heart vnto God.</hi> Truth it is, that the opinion of men is not ſimplie to be neglected: for it is the rule of the Apoſtle that we ſhould <hi>procure things honeſt in the ſight of all men</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 12.17.</note>: but yet the approbation of men muſt not be made the rule of godlineſſe, but only the will and maieſtie of God. It was the commendation of <hi>Enoch</hi> and of <hi>Noah,</hi> that the times wherein they liued being ouerrunne with leaudneſſe, yet they <hi>walked with God</hi>

The hypocrite, if he haue <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> in his mouth, and be buſie about the outward worke, knocking and kneeling, and framing his face to a ſhew of deuotion; he thinketh that he is very religious, and careth not though God ſeeth him within, to haue neither any ſound knowledge nor any true loue to religion. The couetous worldling who rackes all that can be gotten, if he can ſet a color to the world, that no body ſhall ſee his plots and cunning ſhifts, reſpecteth no more; albeit the Lord knoweth how his heart is ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, and hath <hi>made gold his hope</hi>

how the caſe ſtandeth betwixt vs and the Lord. This will not ſerue the turne when all things come to receiue their due triall: then the vizard will be plucked off from euerie hypocrite; then ſhall many a man be approued, whoſe courſe the world now condemneth for follie; and many that now carrie a face and beare out matters with a ſhew, will be found diſſemblers, and the lot of hypocrites will be their portion. Let this perſwade vs to affect ſinceritie and ſinglenes of hart, and alwaies to make it our care, more to regard the acceptance with God, than the account &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of men. It is a ſpeciall point of godlines, &amp; he hath well profited in religion, that hath well learned this leſſon, and this one thing which I ſhall name vnto you is the beſt triall of it; when a man is the ſame alone and in companie; that is, when as that ſinne, that euill courſe which a man knoweth he would not enter into, in the preſence and ſight and knowledge of men, the ſame he doth forbeare when he is by himſelfe, and hath many aduantages and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ſafely and ſecretly to practiſe it. To forbeare to doe euill when men are by to behold it, is nothing, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt hypocrite and reprobate in the world may doe it: but, cloſely and ſecretly to abſtaine, &amp; when one hath many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to it, yet euen for Gods ſake, and for lothneſſe to diſpleaſe him, to forbeare, that is a thing which none but a good man indeed, a child of God can come vnto. To make ſhewes of holineſſe &amp; deuotion in a Church, there to looke ciuillie, and in praying to vſe ſignes of great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and affection, is no great matter, it is not of any value to build vpon, for an hypocrite may come ſo farre: But in a priuate corner, in ones <hi>Chamber</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith <note n="t" place="margin">Matt. 6.6.</note>) apart from the world, where no man can heare or vnderſtand, or take notice of it; there to <hi>powre out ones ſoule before the Lord</hi>

is a ſure rule to trie our ſelues by, if that which we would be thought to be before men, we trauel with our harts, and ſtriue to be indeed, when none can take notice of our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in regard of the ſecrecie of them, but the Lord.

            <p>My method ſhall be this, to let you ſee,<note place="margin">The order of the whole place to the end.</note> how ech branch of theſe verſes dependeth on other, as it were ſo many linkes inchained either to other. Firſt of all, <hi>Zacharie</hi> directeth his ſpeech to the Infant (preſent, in my opinion) and pronounceth of him that he <hi>ſhall be called
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19491:45"/>
the Prophet of the moſt high:</hi> If it be asked why hee ſhall bee ſo ſtiled? it is anſwered, <hi>Becauſe hee ſhall goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his waies.</hi> If we would know what it is, to <hi>prepare the Lords waies,</hi> he ſaith it is, to <hi>giue knowledge of ſaluation to the people.</hi> If we demand wherein this <hi>ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſtands, hee addeth, that it ſtandes in <hi>the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> If we enquire further, out of what fountaine this <hi>ſaluation,</hi> ſtanding in <hi>the remiſſion of ſinnes</hi> hath flowed; he telleth vs, that is come from <hi>the tender mercy of our God.</hi> If we would be informed what is the eſpeciall fruit of this <hi>Mercy of our God,</hi> hee ſetteth it downe thus, that by it is come to paſſe, that <hi>the day-ſpring from an high hath viſited vs.</hi> If laſtly the queſtion be, to what ſpeciall end this <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> hath appeared, hee ſhutteth vp all with this ſweet and gracious concluſion; that the end is, <hi>To giue light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guid our feet into the way of peace.</hi> This is the order of this whole place. I will proſecute euery branch in the ſame order and maner in which it lieth.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the title, to be giuen to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Thou Babe ſhalt be called the Prophet of the moſt high.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which ſpeech is, that all men ſhould take notice of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and acknowledge him to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> of God, called from aboue, and appointed by ſpeciall deputation for the ſeruice of the Church. The verification of which foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we read in the ſtorie. <hi>The multitude counted Iohn as a Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Matt. 14.5.</note>. <hi>All hold Iohn as a Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Matt. 21.26.</note>. But heere may ariſe a doubt: <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe being demanded whether he were <hi>the Prophet, anſwered no</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 1.21.</note>. The anſwer is eaſie, thus. It was the error of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that before the Meſſias there ſhould come a ſpeciall <hi>Prophet,</hi> beſides him that was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, by the name of <hi>Elias.</hi> So it appeareth by that the multitude ſaid on a time touching Chriſt: <hi>This is of a truth the Prophet that ſhould come into the world</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 6.14.</note>, and in another place: <hi>Of a truth this is the Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 7.40.</note>. This error of theirs aroſe out of the words of <hi>Moſes: The Lord thy God will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19491:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
raiſe vp vnto thee a Prophet like vnto mee from among you</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Deu. 18.15.</note>. <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore denieth himſelfe to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> in that ſenſe; he was no ſuch <hi>Prophet</hi> as they looked for. This is the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>Now the doctrine is this; <hi>That it is an eſtate of preferment and credit, for a man to be deputed to the calling and office of a Prophet and miniſter in the Church of God.</hi> Marke how this ariſeth out of this place. <hi>Zacharie</hi> directeth his ſpeech to <hi>Iohn:</hi> He was now at the time of the ſpeaking of theſe words an Infant, there was not then any great matter of outward circumſtance in him to be taken notice of: yet notwithſtanding (quoth <hi>Zacharie</hi>) euen thou O babe, little though thou now be, wrawling in thy cradle, and wrapt vp in clouts, ſhalt in time obtaine this honor, to be reputed and <hi>called a Prophet of the moſt high,</hi> a <hi>Preacher</hi> appointed by him to publiſh the doctrine of <hi>ſaluation</hi> to the world. Thus the manner of ſpeaking, <hi>Now thou art but a ſillie babe, yet ſhalt thou liue to beare the title of one of Gods Prophets,</hi> ſerueth to iuſtifie this doctrine. There is nothing more effectuall to the cleering of this point, than to conſider the matter and buſineſſe about which euery true miniſter of God is emploied; which is not baſe or vulgar, but of as great weight and worth as may be: It is to <hi>giue knowledge of ſaluation, to publiſh peace</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Iſay 52.7.</note>, <hi>to declare to a man his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 33.23.</note>, <hi>to ſaue them that beleeue</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.21.</note>, <hi>to pray men in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20.</note>, <hi>to gather together the Saints,</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> to be Gods mouth to the people in preaching to them from God, and to be the peoples mouth againe in praying for them to God <note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 33.10.</note>. Theſe are no baſe things, no vile ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no meane emploiments, to treat betwixt the Lord and his Church of no worſe matter than the glorie of the one and the ſaluation of the other. Many things might eaſily be heaped vp to this purpoſe, but I will ſatiſfie my ſelfe with this, and proceed to the vſes of this point, which are three.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note>The firſt is an admonition to thoſe who haue by their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19491:46"/>
place to doe in the electing and ordaining of <hi>Miniſters</hi> for ſeuerall congregations; They muſt remember the charge, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.22</note>. The calling is honorable, and therefore not for euery one hand ouer head to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into. It is not meet that the paſſage into the miniſtry ſhould lie open for whomſoeuer: <hi>Who would might conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Kin. 13.33.</note>, it was one of the euils of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time: It wil lay the beauty of the calling in the duſt, and make the world full of ſuch wandring <hi>Leuites,</hi> as <hi>the yong man of Bethlehem Iudah,</hi> whom <hi>Micah</hi> hired for <hi>ten ſhekels of ſiluer by the yeere, and a ſute of apparell and meate and drinke</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iud. 17.7.10.</note>, which will be ready to ſerue the turne of euery Church, ſpoiling patron, and to be at his deuotion, for <hi>a piece of ſiluer and a morſell of bread</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. Sam. 2.36. <hi>The</hi> 2. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The ſecond vſe, is an aduertiſement to all that are entred into that function, to take diligent heed, that they doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may diſgrace ſo honorable a calling. A mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is tied to watchfulneſſe by a double bond; Firſt, as he is a Chriſtian, then as he is a miniſter: whoſoeuer of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſeed had any blemiſh in him ſhould not preſſe to offer before God <note n="o" place="margin">Leu. 21.17.</note>. Many things may be pardoned to others, which in vs will ſeeme intolerable. <hi>If the ſalt haue loſt his ſauour, it is thencefoorth good for nothing</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 5.13.</note>. God grant that the eminency and dignity of our calling may beget in vs a ſteady care to doe nothing which may bring it into diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (for a third vſe),<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Vſe.</note> this maketh againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which is generally caſt vpon the miniſtry. Many ſcorne it in themſelues, accounting it a baſe thing for them or their children to conſecrate their life to the miniſtry of the Goſpell. A cluſter of the ciuill or common law, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (in their ſeeming) than a whole vintage of Diuinity. It is <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, that we ſhould be <hi>had in ſingular loue for our workes ſake</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.13.</note>. In the world it is otherwiſe, hated we be for our workes ſake, and diſpiſed for our profeſſions ſake; It is the common Theme of many being in their cups, or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19491:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
otherwiſe in want of matter to diſcourſe of, to open their mouthes againſt the miniſtry. Be it ſo that ſome deſerue ill enough: yet when men take a pleaſure in theſe kinds of inueying, and ſeeke out of the misbehauiour of ſome to collect concluſions againſt all, it argueth that they ſpeake not out of the hatred of euill, but out of enmity to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thinking that they haue quit themſelues well, if they can bring that into diſgrace. Well, touching thoſe which are faithfull, and make conſcience to <hi>feed</hi> the people <hi>with knowledge and vnderſtanding</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ier. 3.15.</note> this I ſay, and yet not I but the <hi>Lord; Let a man ſo thinke of them as of the miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt, and diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Cor. 4.1.</note>. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt reacheth high: <hi>He that diſpiſeth you diſpiſeth mee</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Luc. 10.16.</note>. It was <hi>Iohns</hi> honor, to be <hi>called a Prophet of the moſt high,</hi> why ſhould it be any mans debaſement to ſerue the ſame maſter, in the ſame buſineſſe? Thus farre touching the firſt branch.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch is the reaſon why <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould be ſtiled <hi>A Prophet, &amp;c: Thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his waies.</hi> This is the true deſcription of a <hi>Prophet</hi> or miniſter; although in it ſome thing there was peculiar to <hi>Iohn;</hi> notwithſtanding true it is of all <hi>Prophets</hi> and miniſters, that they <hi>goe before Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> of old went before Chriſt to bee borne, and they all bore witneſſe of him, <hi>that through his name all that beleeue in him, ſhould receiue remiſſion of ſinnes</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note>. The miniſters ſince Chriſt borne, goe before in reſpect of his ſecond comming, to iudgment, to giue warning of it, and to make men readie for it. <hi>Iohn</hi> went more immediately before Chriſts face, becauſe he was the very next <hi>Prophet</hi> before him, and liued to ſee him in his body, and with his finger to point to him, <hi>Behold the lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 1.29.</note>. Now although it was peculiar to <hi>Iohn,</hi> thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to goe before Chriſt, yet this is common to other miniſters with him, to be meſſengers of Chriſt, and to make the people readie to receiue him. Hence ariſeth this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19491:47"/>
doctrine;<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That it is the office and duty of the true Prophets and miniſters of God, to draw diſciples vnto Chriſt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the people to receiue him.</hi> No man ſhall deſerue the name of a <hi>Prophet</hi> vnleſſe he ſo doe: He muſt profeſſe himſelfe to be Chriſts ſeruant, and muſt aime at the aduancement and ſetting vp of his kingdome. The acknowledgement of this truth may be ſeene in all the <hi>Prophets</hi> iointly: <hi>They all gaue witneſſe to Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note>: they all directed their courſe to this one thing, to beget in the peoples hearts an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance vpon only Chriſt. The ſame did the Apoſtles, both while Chriſt yet liued (for that was their errand when they were firſt ſent out, <hi>The kingdome of heauen is at hand</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Matt. 10.7.</note>) and afterwards alſo, as may be obſerued out of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courſe<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 3.12. &amp;c. ch. 4.11.12. ch. 14.15. ch. 17.3.</note>. Thence came the profeſſion of <hi>Paul; We preach not our ſelues, but Chriſt Ieſus the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 4.5.</note>. For this cauſe alſo it is ſet downe as the marke of Deceiuers, to draw to themſelues, <hi>to draw diſciples after them</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 20.30.</note>. Excellent is the ſimilitude of the Apoſtle, to ſhew both his owne care and euery miniſters duty: <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prepared you for one huſband, to preſent you as a pure virgine vnto Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2.</note>. Often in Scripture is Chriſt compared to an husband, and the Church to a ſpouſe: This life is the time of wooing the laſt iudgement is the mariage day <note n="e" place="margin">Reu. 19.7.</note>: Miniſters are as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, or as <hi>the bridegroomes friends</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 3.29.</note>, to attend vpon the Church, and to treat of this ſpirituall mariage, and to ſeeke to aray and attire the people of God, with <hi>the garments of ſaluation</hi>

Thus this is the duty of all miniſters, not to ſeeke to ſet vp themſelues, or to call the people to them, but to direct vnto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Heare you him, and your ſoule ſhall liue</hi>

               <note n="i" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.1.</note>. We ſee the truth of this doctrine: now let vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of what vſe it may be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as it admoniſheth all Miniſters to ſet themſelues to the aduancement of Chriſts kingdome,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> ſo doth it plainly prooue the neceſſarie vſe of the publike Miniſterie. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19491:48"/>
Scripture maketh no mention of any other outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes to prepare vs vnto Chriſt. Wee cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelues (<hi>for our hearts are wicked aboue all things</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ier. 17 9.</note>) and vnleſſe we be prepared, Chriſt cannot be entertained: Wherefore looke of what neceſſitie the preſence of Chriſt is vnto ſaluation, of the ſame (when we ſpeake of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe) is the Miniſtrie of the word: There is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation but by Chriſt, there is no way for Chriſt to enter in, vntill the word haue made vs ready to receaue him. To refuſe Chriſt, is to reiect grace; to contemne the Word preached, is to keepe out Chriſt. Fetch we a ſimilitude from Phyſicke: The learned Phyſician, intending a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome potion to his patient, firſt giueth him a preparatiue to fit his body to receaue it: If the preparatiue worke not, hee hath ſmall hope to doe good with that which was to follow: So in this; Chriſt purpoſing ſaluation vnto vs, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Preachers before, to make way for grace, &amp; to beget in vs a deſire and expectation of mercy: If the Harbingers be reiected, if wee yeeld not to the courſe taken to prepare vs, there is no hope of Chriſt, there is no likelihood of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. This is the cauſe why the Miniſtrie of the Word is compared to an <hi>Axe</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Matt. 3.10.</note>, becauſe as no beame is put into the building, vntill the worke-mans axe hath made it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the place where it muſt be; ſo no man is coupled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſpirituall frame (the body of Chriſt) to become <hi>the habitation of God by the ſpirit</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 2.22.</note>, vntill the axe of the Word haue pared off his corruption, and by hewing him againe and againe, haue made him fit for ſuch a heauenly ſeruice. Take you heed therefore, all you deſpiſers of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: the Preaching of the Word is a burthen vnto you, and euen a baſe thing in your ſeeming: you ſay of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, as the Athenians did of <hi>Paul, What will this babler ſay</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 17.18.</note>? O that God might vouchſafe to open your eies, to ſee the diuels policie heerein! He will yeeld to you, that, profeſſedly to reiect Chriſt were dangerous: but to ſcoffe and repine and murmure at the Word which you heare, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19491:48"/>
maketh you beleeue, that is nothing. Why will you ſuffer your ſelues to be beguiled? Can you receaue Chriſt before you be prepared? If you know your owne corruption, you will neuer thinke it: or can you (ordinarily) bee prepared but by the publike Miniſtrie? If you know and beleeue the Scripture, you will neuer imagine it. When Chriſt commeth, his Word goeth before; let his Word bee reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and he will not be entertained. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore and knocke</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 3 20.</note>: what knocking meaneth he, but this by his Word? and therefore it there followeth: <hi>If any man heare my voice, &amp;c.</hi> If this Knocking be not regarded, hee himſelfe doth neuer enter. It is vaine to ſay, I loue Chriſt, but him which preacheth Chriſt I doe not loue: Either ſuch an one muſt prepare vs, or Chriſt Ieſus will not dwell with vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this we may know,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> whether we haue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profited by the Word which wee haue ſo often heard. Are our hearts made readie to receaue Chriſt, are we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to entertain him? We are profitable ſcholars. Is there no fitneſſe in vs for this honorable gueſt? we haue loſt our time, and our hearing hitherto hath beene in vaine. But, what is this to be prepared for Chriſt? for this may ſeeme to be ſpoken ſomthing too generally. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> well tell vs; namely, that we are prepared for Chriſt, when we are <hi>Poore and of a contrite ſpirit, and tremble at the Word</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iſay 66.2.</note>. A man is then readie for Chriſt, when his <hi>ſoule thirſteth for him, and his fleſh longeth greatly after him</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 63.1.</note>; when like the woman of Canaan, hee would be glad of a few crummes <note n="r" place="margin">Matt. 15.27.</note> of mercy; when with <hi>Paul</hi> he <hi>counteth all things to be loſſe and dung that he may winne Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note>; when he hath no minde of any thing ſo much as how hee may finde fauour with God; when his owne ſinnes are euen a burden and a deteſtation vnto him, he euen quaketh in his owne conceit, to thinke how hee ſhould doe, if God ſhould call him to a ſtrait account, and proceed againſt him in extremitie. Let vs proceed then: I demand of thee,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19491:49"/>
which haſt now ſo long beene a hearer of the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: Is it thus with thee? Hath thy heart beene plowed vp, and rent in ſunder by the power of the Word, ſo that now the tidings of the Goſpell are muſicke to thine eares, and thy ſpirit within thee crieth out continually, <hi>O ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 35.3.</note>; O my Sauiour, <hi>turne thy face vnto me and haue mercy vpon me, for I am deſolate and poore</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 25.16.</note>? It is an argument, that thou haſt heard with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and maieſt giue a comfortable account of thy hearing. Art thou of a dull and dead heart, not knowing out of thine owne priuate feeling what it is to long for Chriſt, and to thirſt after his righteouſneſſe? Surely thy hearing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath beene fruitleſſe, and thou art yet in thy ſinnes. And truely ſuch are the moſt: Let the myſterie of Chriſt, and of grace in and by him be laid open vnto vs, neuer ſo exactly or comfortably, it doeth no more affect them, than any of the moſt idle tales that can be imagined. It is vnpoſſible, that men prepared for Chriſt, ſhould, when Chriſt is preached, ſtop their eares, <hi>like the deafe Adder</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 58.4.</note>, and voluntarily betake themſelues to a kinde of ſetled drowſineſſe. Thus much of the reaſon, why <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be called <hi>a Prophet,</hi> where we haue ſeene what is the vſe and neceſſitie of the publike Miniſtrie.</p>
            <p>The third branch followeth: wherein is taught, what it is, to <hi>prepare the way of the Lord;</hi> namely, to <hi>giue knowledge of ſaluation to Gods people.</hi> Now to <hi>giue knowledge</hi> in this place, is not, to <hi>infuſe knowledge:</hi> (for no mortall man can doe that) but it ſignifieth to <hi>giue notice,</hi> and to publiſh in that maner, as that all may perceaue what is meant, and that, if they remaine ignorant, the fault may appeare to be their owne. This was the office of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and this hee did, as appeareth in the holy Storie <note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 3.11. &amp;c.</note>, and for that cauſe he was called a <hi>Cryer</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Matt. 3.3.</note>. The words thus expounded doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford vs three doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>The firſt is; <hi>That he who deſires to make way for Chriſt, and to draw diſciples vnto him, muſt ſtudie to be able to open to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19491:49"/>
the people the hid treaſure of the Scripture:</hi> Wee ſee heere, that it is the Miniſters dutie to <hi>prepare the way for Chriſt;</hi> now to prepare a way for Chriſt, is to <hi>giue knowledge of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:</hi> And what is that, but (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) to <hi>publiſh the ſecret of the Goſpell</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6.19.</note>, and to lay foorth the myſterie of Chriſt in that maner, that euen the <hi>ſimple</hi> may attaine <hi>ſharpneſſe of wit, and children knowledge and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 1.4.</note> thereby? A miniſter is called an <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20</note>: and much is required to the diſcharge of an ambaſſage. He that ſhall be therein emploied, muſt be a man of vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, able to treat to and fro of the affaires of his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign as occaſion ſhal be offred. The ſame is true in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meſſage: He that carieth it had need to haue <hi>the tong of the Learned</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Iſay 50 4.</note>, and it were good, that <hi>his lips did preſerue knowledge</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 2.7.</note>, that hee may be able to ſatisfie the doubts of thoſe which deſire certainty of information in Gods trueth. This made <hi>Elihu</hi> call him <hi>one of a thouſand</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 33.23.</note>, and <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note>?</p>
            <p>This may bee a good admonition to thoſe which affect this calling: that they preſſe not rawly into it:<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, that thou <hi>haue eat the role</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Eze. 3.1.</note>, that thy <hi>mouth be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 1.9.</note>, and thy heart filled with the right vnderſtanding of the myſterie of Chriſt; otherwiſe thou canſt haue no hope to prepare the way for Chriſt, or to winne ſoules vnto God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond doctrine from hence is;<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>That the Miniſter deſiring to prepare ſoules for Chriſt, muſt ſo preach in that plaine and familiar ſort, as that (if it be poſſible) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſaluation may from him be deriued vnto all that heare him.</hi> This is iuſtifiable by this place: For how ſhall a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be truely ſaid to <hi>giue knowledge of ſaluation,</hi> if he lap vp his ſpeech in ſuch a miſt of words, that the meaneſt and ſhalloweſt among the hearers cannot vnderſtand it? Such a kind of preaching is rightly compared, to a <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet giuing an vncertaine ſound,</hi> at the hearing whereof no man can tel how or when to <hi>prepare himſelfe to the battel</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.8.</note>:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19491:50"/>
ſo if hee which ſpeakes in publike, doe ſpeake in ſuch high termes &amp; obſcure phraſes, that ordinarie men cannot conceiue what he intends, how ſhall they by his preaching be ſtirred vp to any good ſeruice, how ſhall they prepare themſelues to fight againſt Satan? Hence was that worthy reſolution of <hi>Pauls; I had rather in the Church to ſpeake fiue words &amp;c. that I might alſo inſtruct others, than ten thouſand words in a ſtrange toong</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.19.</note>: In which place by a <hi>ſtrange tongue,</hi> may not only be vnderſtood, the ſpeaking of <hi>Latin;</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or the like amongſt Engliſh men, but the ſpeaking of the mother tongue in ſuch a ſtrange faſhion, that it may ſeeme all one to the hearers, as if one ſpake in the moſt vnknowen language. The want of this painted eloquence brought <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching into diſgrace among the learned <hi>Grecians,</hi> whence came that phraſe, <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of preaching</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.21</note>; yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſtill went on without <hi>excellency of words,</hi> or <hi>the entiſing ſpeech of mans wiſedome,</hi> and affected only <hi>the plaine euidence of the ſpirit</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.1.4</note>: ſo that this was no ſmall comfort vnto him, that he had preached the Goſpell after that familiar maner, that he might truly ſay, <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid vnto them that are loſt</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">2. Cor. 4.3.</note>. It is a fit compariſon, in which a Preacher is likened to a <hi>Nurſe</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">1. The. 2.7.</note>. Nurſes doe halfe chew the meare to the little ones, and doe babble with them in their owne ſtammering and vnperfit language: ſo muſt a Preacher proportion his doctrine to his hearers capacity, and fit his tongue to their conceiuing; otherwiſe he ſhall neuer <hi>giue the knowledge of ſaluation,</hi> but ſhall rather make it more obſcure.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note>This firſt belongeth as a reproofe to ſome, who (like the old <hi>Phariſies) louing the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 12.41.</note>, ſoare ſo high, in ſuch vncouth words, and in ſuch an affected kind of eloquence, that they become as <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.11</note> vnto their hearers: It were all one if they preached to them in <hi>Latin</hi> or in <hi>French.</hi> Let all ſuch remember, that their office is, to bring the people to <hi>the knowledge of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now the plainer the Preacher is, the ſooner ſhall the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19491:50"/>
people be brought to <hi>the knowledge of ſaluation</hi> by his meanes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this diſcouereth the miſconceit of many hearers; who, if a Preacher haue gallant words,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull phraſes, and interlace his ſermon with other toongs, ſtraightway admire him, as extraordinarily learned and profound. But I aske of thee, what <hi>knowledge of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> haſt thou got by ſuch a ſermon? how is thy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding holpen in the miſtery of Chriſt? Thou wilt ſay (perhaps) that he was too deepe for thee. What good then ſhall he doe to thy ſoule, if, by hearing him, thou art brought no neerer to the knowledge of God than thou waſt before? If thou wouldeſt heare for thy profit, pray to God to ſend thee ſuch an one, which may ſpeake to thy conſcience, which may ſeaſon thy heart with ſoundneſſe of knowledge, and not tickle thy <hi>itching eares</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.3.</note> with pleaſingneſſe of words.</p>
            <p>The third doctrine from hence is; <hi>That thoſe which are ignorant in the true way and meanes of ſaluation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>5.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>are not yet prepared for Chriſt, nor fit to entertaine him.</hi> The reaſon heereof is manifeſt by the text: <hi>Iohn</hi> muſt prepare a way for Chriſt; that is, he muſt make men ready to receiue Chriſt; How ſhall he doe that? By labouring to bring them to <hi>the knowledge of ſaluation:</hi> Therefore they which are not yet come ſo farre, as to know what is abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation, are not come the firſt ſtep towards Chriſt. It is truly ſaid by the Apoſtle, that they whoſe <hi>cogitations are darkned, be ſtrangers from the life of God</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note>. Heare what Chriſt ſaith; <hi>This is life euerlaſting, to know God to be the only very God, and whom he hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note>. Knoweſt thou not Chriſt, what he is, what he hath done, how that which he hath done may be auaileable to thy ſoule? thou art not yet in the way to life eternall. This <hi>Paul</hi> begged of God for his hearers, <hi>That they might be fulfilled with knowledge of Gods will in all wiſedome and ſpirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Col. 1.9.</note>, <hi>that they might be able to comprehend, what is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19491:51"/>
the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the loue of Chriſt, &amp;c</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Vſe.</note>This ſerueth to ſhew the ineuitable danger of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignorance of the multitude.

               <note n="i" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.7.</note>. That we may fully vnderſtand this point how ſinnes are remitted by Chriſt and for him; it is to be noted, that in ſinne there are three things: The firſt is the crime it ſelfe, or the ſwaruing and ſtraying from the will of God, by which God is offended. The ſecond is, the guilt, by which the party offending is liable vnto eternall puniſhment. The third is, the ſtaine or blot, which the ſin committed leaueth in the offender; by which there followeth an aptneſſe or prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe either to the ſame ſinne or to anie other. Theſe three are taken away by the merit of Chriſt: The diſobedience or crime, is taken away by his obedience. The guilt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued by his ſuffrings. The corruption hidden by his holineſſe, and the very being of it daily diminiſhed, and by the ſtrength, power and working of his ſpirit. If it be demanded how this can be? I anſwer, it is done by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19491:52"/>
by which there is a kinde of tranſlation or putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the beleeuers ſinne vnto Chriſt, and of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to the beleeuer. Chriſts obedience is accounted the obedience of the beleeuer: Chriſts ſuffrings, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of the beleeuer: Chriſts holineſſe, the holineſſe of the beleeuer. And ſo God accounteth Chriſts obedience, paſſion and holines to be the beleeuers, as much as if they were really in him, and as if he himſelfe had actually and perſonally performed the ſame. The right vnderſtanding of this point is the key of Religion, and the ſtaffe of all true comfort in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>Now the ſecond thing to be opened (which is indeed the doctrine of the place) is; <hi>That ſaluation ſtands in the Remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And this is iuſtified by that ſaying of the Pſalme; <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiuen, and whoſe ſinne is couered</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Pſa. 32.1.</note>. Now looke wherein ſtands hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, therein ſtands ſaluation: for what happineſſe is there beſides ſaluation? And the reaſon of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is apparent. Man was firſt caſt out of Paradiſe for ſinne; neither doth any thing hinder his returne but onely ſinne: for ſo long as his ſinnes remaine, they are as a <hi>waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie burden</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 38.4.</note>, to preſſe him downe to hell, and his <hi>wages</hi> and ſtipend is eternall <hi>Death</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note>. Therefore if ſinne bee taken away and pardoned, God hath againſt him no matter of diſpleaſure, and Chriſts obedience being imputed to him, heauen cannot bee denied him, hee muſt needes be ſaued. This may briefly ſerue to make plaine this doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>The firſt vſe of it, is to ſtrengthen vs in a notable point, which is, that in the matter of ſaluation, all merit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of our owne workes, are vtterly excluded: The ground whereof is in this place very expreſſe. For I demand: wherein doth that <hi>ſaluation</hi> ſtand, which muſt be publiſhed by the miniſter in the Church of God? <hi>Zachary</hi> anſwereth, that it ſtands in the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſinnes. Now, deſert and remiſſion cannot agree: If my plea for ſaluation muſt be, the pardon of my ſinnes, where is my merit? If I haue ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19491:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by deſert of workes, I haue it vpon right: but if I obtaine it by the pardon of my ſinnes, I haue it wholly vpon courteſie. This is a direct kind of reaſoning: and it is iuſtified by <hi>S. Pauls</hi> courſe. His maine propoſition is, that <hi>a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the law</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Rom 3.28.</note>. This he proueth (as by other reaſons, ſo) by a teſtimony fetched out of the two and thirtieth Pſalme. <hi>Euen as Dauid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>declareth the bleſſedneſſe of the man vnto whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 4.6.</note>. <hi>Dauid</hi> placeth happineſſe in the remiſſion of ſinnes: If in remiſſion of ſinnes, what place is left for workes in this buſineſſe? And this is the expreſſe doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Eternall life is the gift of God</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note>: and what is more free than gift? <hi>By grace are ye ſaued through faith, &amp;c. not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 2.8.9.</note>. <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we had done, but according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſaued vs</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note>. If any workes might deſerue, what more meritorious than the ſufferings of Martyrs? yet <hi>the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie, which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note>. This is directly againſt the doctrine of Popery, which is not aſhamed to maintaine, that <hi>Works are the proper cauſe of life euerlaſting</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Rhem Test. in Gal. <hi>6.9.</hi>
               </note>. Let Papiſt (if they can) reconcile and make theſe agree, how ſaluation can be grounded vpon the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and yet be ours by the dignity of our workes. They crie out againſt vs in regard of this doctrine two waies. Firſt, that life eternall and ſaluation are often in Scripture promiſed as the reward of good workes, and that therefore life eternall is of merit. I anſwer, that reward is twofold. Firſt, of fauour. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of debt. So <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelfe doth diſtinguiſh <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note>. <hi>Now life eternall,</hi> is a reward of fauour: <hi>It is the gift of God</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note>. Indeed in the matter of ſaluation God hath made himſelfe a debter: But how? By his free promiſe, not by the merit of any worke. If he hath vouchſafed to promiſe life eternall to our obedience, it is true we may claime it as due, but not becauſe of the excellencie of our obedience, but becauſe of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19491:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the truth and ſtrength of the promiſe. Very effectuall is that phraſe of the Apoſtles, when he calleth life eternall, a <hi>Reward of inheritance</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Col. 3.24.</note>: which prooues, that God doth not giue it for Works, as a thing by them deſerued, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are become his children by the free grace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. Secondly, they crie out, that by this meanes we deſtroy good Works. I anſwer, that that is a meere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. For wee ſay, that none can bee ſaued without good Works, becauſe <hi>God hath ordained them that we ſhould walke in them</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Eph 2.10.</note>; we teach, that that <hi>Faith</hi> is vaine and <hi>dead</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 2.26.</note>, which doth <hi>not worke by loue</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note>: For albeit we muſt not bee <hi>zealous in good works</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note>, with an hope to merit thereby, yet we know and preach, that there are ſundry <hi>neceſſarie vſes</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 3.14.</note> of them, for which they ought not to bee neglected. So then this is the firſt vſe of this doctrine, to eſtabliſh vs in the doctrine of free iuſtification without works. If I would bee ſaued, the pardon of my ſins, the hiding and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of mine own actions, is the thing which I muſt ſeek after: therefore what warrant haue I to relie vpon my own deſeruing? This is needfull to be noted, becauſe this error goeth farre, and too too many doe truſt to their owne deeds. If thou wouldeſt be ſaued, this muſt be thy Plea: <hi>O Lord I haue ſinned, euen in my beſt courſes, I beſeech thee for Chriſt to pardon mee:</hi> and not, <hi>Lord behold this I haue done, thus I haue deſerued, therefore I require thee of thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to reward me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note>The ſecond vſe, is matter of exhortation to euerie one of vs. For behold, our ſaluation ſtands in the remiſſion of ſinnes: Doſt thou then deſire to be ſaued? then thou muſt labour that thy ſinnes may bee pardoned: This followeth neceſſarily. It is a wofull thing to looke vpon the moſt: They pretend an expectation and a deſire of ſaluation; talke with them, they will ſay they deſire it and pray for it: yet of all other things, <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> is that which is leaſt laboured for. If any man ſhould with <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſtand in <hi>the window of his houſe, and looke</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Pro. 7.6.</note> and conſider the

courſes of men, how ſhould hee ſee them emploied? Some gaping after wealth, ſome ſtriuing to become great, and to ſet their <hi>nest on hie</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Hab. 2.9.</note>, ſome running after vaine delights, ſome plotting and ſtudying for reuenge, ſome drinking, ſome gaming, ſome playing the wantons, ſome pranking vp themſelues, all of them guiltie before God, of more ſinnes than there be graſſe piles vpon the earth, and yet ſcarſely any one ſeriouſly buſying himſelfe about this, how his ſinnes may bee pardoned, and his iniquities co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. If we ſhould ſee a malefactor guiltie of many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall treſpaſſes, taken and impriſoned, and the day of the aſſiſe approching, and yet the ſame man to be ſecure and iocund and gamſome, would wee not all condemne him for a deſperate perſon, and ſay, we wondered how he could be ſo merrie, hauing ſo many foule matters to be put in againſt him, and not knowing how to eſcape? yes doubtles. And yet euen ſo is the caſe with vs: <hi>Our ſinnes are more in number than the haires of our head</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 41.12.</note>; taken we be, and cannot hide our ſelues from the Lord, (for <hi>whither ſhall we flee from his preſence</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 139.7.</note>? anſwer to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wee cannot, to endure the triall is a thing vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if thou, <hi>O Lord, ſtraitly markest iniquities, O Lord who ſhall ſtand</hi>

               <note n="l" place="margin">Luc. 23.30.</note>. What then ſhall we ſay of our owne ſelues, who for all this, ſleepe vpon the elbowes of our owne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and put theſe things farre from our thoughts, and neuer goe about to ſue out a diſcharge, and to bee comfortablie ſecured in our conſciences of Gods fauour? This ſecuritie cannot be excuſed; well may we ſleepe in our negligence, but our <hi>Damnation ſleepeth not</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.3.</note>, and wee ſhall ſurely periſh in our careleſneſſe. Thou wilt ſay (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) vnto me; You ſpeake much of my negligence, you blame me for not ſeeking the pardon of my ſinnes, but you
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19491:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
teach mee not the way by which I might obtaine this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor. Hearken therfore, whoſoeuer thou art, which deſireſt to be inſtructed in this thing. There is none can forgiue ſinnes but God; the only perſon, in and by whom ſinnes are pardoned, is Chriſt Ieſus. The meanes of obtaining pardon from God the Father by Chriſt, is ſet downe briefly by S. <hi>Iohn: If we acknowledge our ſinnes, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iust to forgiue vs our ſinnes</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.9.</note>. Thus then thou muſt proceed if thou deſire <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> Firſt, thou muſt vſe a diligent and ſerious examination of thine owne heart by the law of God, to ſee how the caſe ſtandeth with thee, and what ſinnes and corruptions thou art guiltie of: This the Scripture teacheth; <hi>Let vs ſearch and try our waies</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Lam. 3 40.</note>. Secondly, thou muſt in thine own thoughts arraigne thy ſelfe before God, ſuppoſing that euen now the day of reckning were, and thou wert now inſtantly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer before God. Thirdly, thou muſt put vp an accuſation againſt thy ſelfe, ripping vp all thy knowne ſinnes, without leſſening them, without excuſing them, without hiding them, without taking vpon thee to defend them: Thus did <hi>Dauid; I know mine iniquities, and my ſinne is euer before me. Againſt thee, againſt thee only haue I ſinned &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 51.3.4.</note>. Thus did <hi>Ezra; Our iniquities are increaſed ouer our head, and our treſpaſe is growne vp to the heauen</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ezra 9.6.</note>. Fourthly, thou muſt goe on, to giue the ſentence againſt thy ſelfe, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou art worthy of euerlaſting death and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Thus did <hi>Daniel; O Lord vnto vs belongeth open ſhame</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Dan. 9 7.</note>: Thus did the <hi>Prodigall, I am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luc. 15.21.</note>. Fiftly, thou muſt with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as thou poſſibly canſt, entreate the Lord for Chriſts ſake to pardon thee, and neuer leaue him, till he giue this bleſſed anſwer to thy conſcience, that all thy ſinnes are cleane put out of his remembrance. Thus we are taught to doe; <hi>Take vnto you words, and turne to the Lord, and ſay vnto him, Turne away all iniquity and receiue vs graciouſly</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Hoſ. 14 3.</note>. Thus did <hi>Daniel; O my God encline thine care and heare &amp;c. O Lord
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19491:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heare, O Lord forgiue, O Lord conſider &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Dan. 9.18.19.</note>. Laſtly, thou muſt begge grace and ſtrength to be able to walke in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life. So did <hi>Dauid; Let thy good ſpirit lead me into the land of righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 143.10.</note>. This is the only way to obtaine <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſinnes, if we would be ſaued, this is a thing which ought dayly to be done; we muſt be euer reckning with our ſelues, ſtill aſciting ourſelues before God, ſtill laying open our corruptions before him, ſtill bewailing our weakeneſſes, ſtill ſuing for mercy, ſtill labouring that our ſinnes may be ſhaken off, and the graces of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in vs. Are theſe ſtrange things to our knowledge, ſtrange to our practiſe, haue we neuer thought vpon taking this ſerious and ſtrict and thorow courſe with our ſelues? ſurely our ſinnes doe yet hang vpon the file in Gods high court, the bill againſt vs is vncancelled, and in the day of account we cannot eſcape. It is my duty <hi>to giue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſaluation,</hi> and to teach that our ſaluation ſtands in the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſinnes, and to ſhew you the way how this <hi>remiſſion</hi> may be obtained: and <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe to ſhew you the good and the right way</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">1. Sa. 13.23.</note>. If now, when the way is thus ſanded foorth vnto you, you will ſay, as they did of old, <hi>We will not walke therein</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ier. 6.16.</note>, you muſt ſuffer mee to conclude with <hi>Moſes, I call heauen and earth to record againſt you, this day, that you ſhall ſhortly periſh</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Deut 4.26.</note>. Thus much for the fourth branch.</p>
            <p>The fift is the fountaine out of which this <hi>ſaluation,</hi> which ſtands in the <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> doth flow, in thoſe words, <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God.</hi> The phraſe of ſpeech here is very effectuall. For <hi>Zachary</hi> ſatisfieth not himſelfe to ſay <hi>mercy,</hi> but he mentioneth, <hi>Bowels of mercy.</hi> It is ſpoken after the maner of men, to note out an exceeding tenderneſſe and inwardneſſe of compaſſion, ſuch as is, when a pitifull perſon his very bowels yearne and are mooued within him, to behold ſome wofull or diſtreſſed ſpectacle. So the <hi>mercy</hi> of God in this caſe is not ordinarie, but more full of commiſeration, than any
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19491:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man poſſibly can imagine. Hence are we taught that, (which hath beene often touched in this Hymne) namely, <hi>That the ſupreme cauſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>the firſt root of our ſaluation, is the riches of Gods mercy, the tenderneſſe of his voluntary and free compaſſion towards vs.</hi> Hence is it that the elect are called <hi>Veſſels of mercy</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 9.23.</note>, becauſe the whole worke of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can be aſcribed to no other thing but only to mercy. Excellent is the place of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 2.1.3.4 5.</note>; Thus and thus we were by <hi>nature, dead in treſpaſſes and in ſins, children of wrath &amp;c.</hi> Whence is it that we are brought into a better eſtate? <hi>God, which is rich in mercy &amp;c. hath quickned vs, &amp;c. Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe that he had ſometimes beene a <hi>blaſphemer, and a perſecuter and an oppreſſor:</hi> whence came it, that he was not ſo ſtill? was it from himſelfe? no: <hi>I was receiued to mercy,</hi> ſaith he <note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13</note>. <hi>Bleſſed be God &amp;c. which according to his abundant mercy &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.3.</note>. The Scripture is very preciſe in this point, in aſcribing euery ſpecialty to Gods <hi>mercy</hi> and free grace. Touching election, it is called <hi>the election of grace</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 11.5.</note>. Touching vocation, it is ſaid to be <hi>according to grace</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">2. Tim. 1.9.</note>. Touching faith, it is ſaid to be <hi>giuen</hi>

               <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note>. Touching life eternall, it is termed <hi>a gift</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note>. The holy Scripture laboureth in nothing more, than to prooue that God was mooued by nothing in the matter of mans ſaluation, but only by his <hi>mercy. I, euen I, am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne ſake</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iſay 42.25.</note>. And indeed if our naturall eſtate be conſidered, it muſt needs be, that all will be aſcribed to <hi>mercy: Children of wrath</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 2 3.</note>, <hi>Enemies to God</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note>, <hi>our imaginations onely euill</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note>, <hi>our wiſedome death</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8.6.</note>, <hi>Reprobate to euery good worke</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note>. What was there (thinke we) to induce God, or to encline or bend him to doe ought for vs? how muſt not all needs be ſaid to flow from his free mercy? Euery ſpirituall man may truly ſay in reſpect of ſpirituall things, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of his wealth, <hi>God hath had mercy on mee, and therefore I haue all theſe things</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gen. 33.11</note>; or as the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19491:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church acknowledgeth; <hi>Lord thou haſt wrought all our workes for vs</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Iſay 26.12.</note>.</p>
            <p>The vſe is, ſtill to maintaine the glory of God,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> and to beate downe the naturall pride and preſuming of mans heart: merit and grace can neuer agree <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note>: that which is by <hi>mercy</hi> is not by <hi>workes,</hi> that which is by <hi>workes</hi> is not by <hi>mercy.</hi> And know we this, that we haue made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in godlineſſe, when we haue learned out of the due conſideration of our owne ſpirituall weakneſſe, and out of the liuely apprehenſion of our owne loſt and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtate, effectually and affectionately to acknowledge, that had it not beene for the vnſpeakeable riches of Gods mercy, we could neuer haue come one piece of a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen. And indeed, vntill a man is come to the effectuall acknowledgement and vnderſtanding of an abſolute miſerie in himſelfe, without any power left in himſelfe, ſo much as by a thought to wiſh or further his owne true good, he may prate of the mercy of God, but he can neuer truly and comfortably apprehend it. God is ſo ielous of it, that if we goe about to temper any other thing therewith more or leſſe, the ſweetneſſe thereof is vtterly loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may be a comfort vnto vs,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> that looke how much we take from our naturall humor by giuing all to Gods mercy, ſo much we adde to our ſpirituall ſetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doe make the eſtate of our ſoules ſo much the ſurer. For, if that which had the firſt beginning from Gods mercy, were by our endeuours to be perfited, we might wel doubt of our ſaluation; but when we rely wholly vpon Gods mercy, there is no cauſe of feare: becauſe the mercy of God is (as himſelfe) perpetuall and vnalterable. There is nothing in vs that began it, there is nothing in vs that can alter it.</p>
            <p>The ſixt branch now followeth, touching the eſpeciall fruits of this <hi>tender mercy of our God:</hi> and that is, that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited vs.</hi> Here we muſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19491:56"/>
enquire. 1. What the <hi>day-ſpring</hi> is. 2. Who is meant by it. 3. Why it is ſaid to be <hi>from an hie.</hi> Firſt, by <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> is meant literally, the firſt appearance and breaking of the day, in the Eaſt part of heauen, foretelling the neere riſing and approching of the Sunne. Secondly, by <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> is ſpiritually vnderſtood Chriſt Ieſus. It ſeemeth that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> had reference to the ancient Prophecies, touching <hi>a ſtarre that ſhould come of Iaacob</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Num 24.17</note>, and of a <hi>Sunne of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which ſhould ariſe</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Mal. 4 2.</note>. Thirdly, it is ſaid to be <hi>from on hie,</hi> to teach vs from whence this refreſhing commeth, not from earth, not from <hi>below,</hi> not from the deuice or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of Man; but from Heauen, from the free grace and mercy and power of God: And it is alſo ſaid to <hi>viſite vs;</hi> to note out (as hath beene before obſerued) our wofull extremitie without Chriſt: inaſmuch as the word <hi>(viſite)</hi> doeth ordinarily betoken a ſicke and diſtreſſed eſtate in thoſe which are viſited. So that this is the ſenſe; that by the great mercy of God, it is come to paſſe, that Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, (who is the light and comfort of his Church) hath broken foorth, and hath caſt out his beames for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cheering of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>If this clauſe were to bee handled apart, manie things might be gathered thence: but treating of it now with the reſt, and ſo, neither repeating out of it things alreadie touched, nor yet raiſing from it ſuch points as that which followeth will giue vs more full occaſion to conſider, theſe are the chiefe things to bee noted hence.<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Firſt, <hi>That the comming of Chriſt into the World, to worke our ſaluation, is the principall euidence and the chiefe fruit of Gods mercie.</hi> Conſider how this is raiſed. <hi>Zacharie</hi> had ſpoken of the <hi>bowels of Gods mercy,</hi> that is, of the deepeſt meaſure of his grace and compaſſion: Now, as an inſtance and proofe thereof, he doth inſiſt eſpecially vpon this, the riſing of the <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe</hi> Chriſt Ieſus. As if he had ſaid: Many waies is the mercy of God made knowne vnto vs, the earth is full of it, but this exceeds all, that hee hath
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19491:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enlightened the World by his Sonne, and hath viſited vs with ſo great ſaluation To this agreeth the ſpeech of <hi>Paul, God ſetteth out his loue toward vs, ſeeing, &amp;c. Chriſt died for vs</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note>. His meaning is, that in other things the mercy of God is not obſcure, but the myſtery of Chriſt is (as it were) a ſtage, vpon which he hath ſet it forth, that all men might behold in it the fulneſſe therof. <hi>In this</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn) appeared the loue of God, becauſe he ſent his onely begotten Sonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World &amp;c</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.9.</note>. <hi>In this:</hi> meaning, that although it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in other things, yet <hi>in this</hi> eſpecially. The reaſon is plaine: It is the mercy of God, that we liue and breath, and enioy health and peace. In theſe things Gods loue is to be ſeene; but what were theſe without Chriſt, according to that ſaying; <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, though hee ſhould winne the whole world, if hee loſe his owne ſoule</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 16.26.</note>? All other comforts without an intereſt into Chriſt, doe but helpe to encreaſe our condemnation.</p>
            <p>This ſerueth to diſcouer our folly.<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> Of all the mercies of God, that, of Chriſt is the chiefeſt; yet of all the reſt it is leaſt ſought for. We are (the moſt) right of the Epicures minde, if the ſides and belly be well, let the reſt goe how it will. Heerein we are like children, who looke vpon the babies in a booke, but care not for the matter. Theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things are but toics and trifles in compariſon, them we gaze vpon, vpon them we doe euen fix our deſires. It ought not to be ſo, neither indeed is it ſo with true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: they are like <hi>Dauid;</hi> who when he beheld the men of his time, reioycing in their <hi>Wheat</hi> and their <hi>Wine,</hi> cried out, <hi>Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon mee</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 4.6.</note>, as it were ſcorning all things els in reſpect of that. Remember we then: This is the height of Gods mercy, that hee hath giuen vs Chriſt; let it be the height, yea, the verie All, of our deſires to enioy Chriſt. Of all cares, let this bee our chiefe care, how we may be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Another point obſeruable hence is;<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>The ſtableneſſe and vnchangeableneſſe of that worke of ſaluation which is wrought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19491:57"/>
by Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> It muſt be ſo, ſeeing it is ſaid to be <hi>from on hie;</hi> out of heauen and from God: Apply to it wee may that rule of <hi>Gamaliel: If this counſell bee of God, yee cannot deſtroy it</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 5.39.</note>: ſo this thing, is <hi>from on hie,</hi> it hath fetched the beginning from God, therefore it cannot bee fruſtrated. All things vnder the Moone are ſubiect to change, the things aboue are firme and immutable. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning touching the certainty of <hi>ſaluation</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note>. He goeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hie to the foundation of all, Gods eternall Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is vnchangeable, therefore their Iuſtification is firme, therefore their Glorification is certaine. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> by their falſe doctrine deſtroied the faith of certain (for it was not built vpon the Rocke) but <hi>The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God remaineth ſure,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <note n="f" place="margin">2.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note>This is, firſt, a great comfort to all true beleeuers: Their ſaluation dependeth not vpon vncertainties: hee is come <hi>from on hie,</hi> which hath vndertaken it. This is an <hi>Anchor of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfaſt</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note>. <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note>Secondly, this <hi>(from on hie)</hi> may be a good admonition to vs, if we deſire a part with Chriſt, to labour to pul &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire our affections from earthly things.

               <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 8.23.</note>, meaning, that becauſe they were ſuch as did ſauour onely of earthly things, therefore Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and grace could not enter into their hearts: If we euer be like ſwine, muzling in the ground, and like the Mole or Want, burying our ſelues in the earth, we make our ſelues vnfit for the kingdome of God: The Church hath the <hi>Moone vnder her feet</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now come vnto the ſeuenth and laſt branch, namely, the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end why this <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> hath appeared, which is, <hi>To giue light, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſumme of the place is, A kindneſſe or benefit beſtowed: the partie by whom it is beſtowed wee haue heard of: <hi>(The Day-ſpring from on hie).</hi> Now we haue heere two things to bee conſidered of: 1. The ſtate and condition of the parties to whom it is giuen (they <hi>ſit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death</hi>). 2. The qualitie of the benefit, <hi>(To giue light,</hi> and, <hi>to guide into the way of peace.)</hi> The former ſheweth how miſerable we be without Chriſt: The latter, what happineſſe is offered to vs in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In handling the former wee muſt firſt enquire the ſenſe, namely, what is meant by <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> and what <hi>by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death.</hi> The word <hi>(Darkneſſe)</hi> muſt not bee taken literally, for any outward, materiall, earthly or ſenſible darkneſſe; ſuch as is when the heauens are ouerwhelmed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19491:58"/>
with clouds, the Sunne ſet, the ſtarres hidden, and the Moone not appearing, and neither fire nor candle to bee gotten. But it muſt be taken in a ſpirituall ſenſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the inward parts, to the ſoule and conſcience. And being ſo taken, it betokeneth two things. 1. Want of true ſauing knowledge: 2. Want of true ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Thus <hi>Light,</hi> in Scripture is taken: firſt, for true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>That the Eies of your vnderſtanding may be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 1.18.</note>: Secondly for true comfort: <hi>Light is ſowen for the Righteous, and ioy for the vpright in heart</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note>. So alſo <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> is put for the contrarie. Firſt, for <hi>Ignorance: Men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued darkneſſe rather than Light</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 3.10.</note>: <hi>Hauing their cogitation darkned</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note>. Secondly, for amazedneſſe and perplexitie of ſpirit: <hi>If they looke to the earth, behold darkneſſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Iſay 5.30.</note>. Therefore Hell, which is the ſeat of Horror, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> led <hi>Darkneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Matt. 18.12.</note>. So then by thoſe which <hi>ſit in darkneſſe,</hi> are meant thoſe which lie buried in ignorance and blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vtterly deſtitute of all true ſpirituall conſolation.</p>
            <p>Now to this, there is added another clauſe, <hi>(The ſhadow of death.)</hi> A phraſe vſuall in Scripture, ſignifying an eſtate brought, as it were, within the coaſtes and borders, and (as I may ſo ſpeake) within the reach of death. So that the meaning of both clauſes together is this; That thoſe to whom Chriſt hath appeared as a Sauiour, were without knowledge, without comfort, without any meanes or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of life eternall in themſelues. This is the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Heere then is ample occaſion giuen to ſpeake of our naturall eſtate without Chriſt: The miſerie whereof ſtands in three things. 1. Want of true knowledge. 2. Want of true comfort. 3. Subiection and liableneſſe to death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. That theſe three are all true of euery naturall man, I will declare briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>And firſt, <hi>That euery naturall man is deſtitute of true knowledge,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that naturally our <hi>Cogitations are darkned through Ignorance</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note>: that <hi>we are vnwiſe</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Tit 3.3.</note>, that is, ſuch as vnderſtand not <hi>What
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19491:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the will of the Lord is</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 5.17.</note>: that <hi>the Wiſedome of our fleſh is death and enmitie againſt God</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 8.6.7.</note>: that <hi>we neither perceiue, nor can know the things of the ſpirit of God</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.</note>. And of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we haue examples; as in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who could not tell what to make of the doctrine of Regeneration <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 3.9.</note>; and in the learned Athenians, who <hi>mocked</hi> at that which <hi>Paul taught</hi> touching the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17 32.</note>. The moſt points of Religion ſeeme to fleſh and bloud, vnreaſonable, abſurd, vnlikely. Man hath no knowledge of God by nature, but onely ſo much as may ſerue to condemne him.</p>
            <p>We are taught by this, firſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> to diſclaime all opinion of freewill, that is, of power in man (of himſelfe) to embrace and to entertaine good when it is offred. This is certaine, that where the minde of man hath no power to conceiue, there the will hath no power to embrace. Now it is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued heere that we are all in <hi>darkneſſe;</hi> nay euen <hi>darkneſſe</hi> it ſelfe <note n="b" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.8.</note>. We are poſſeſſed with that extreme ignorance and dulneſſe in the things of God, that (of our ſelues) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vnderſtand them: Therefore, as God muſt firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our mindes, before we can conceiue any good, ſo hee muſt firſt bend and frame and new mould our willes, before wee can truely affect, nay before wee can once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or leane towards the ſame. Let the patrons of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will ſee how they can reconcile theſe things, namely, that man ſhould naturally lie groueling in a thicke miſt of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall darkneſſe, and yet ſhould haue power in himſelfe to chuſe that which is good, without ſpeciall and particular enabling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this aduiſeth vs, not to admit our owne ſenſe and conceit as a Iudge in matters of Religion.<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Vſe.</note> The blinde (we ſay) is vnfit to iudge of colours, and naturall man, to determine of holy things. Hee that will beleeue nothing, but that which his owne reaſon ſhall approoue, nor doe nothing more than his owne corrupt affection ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto, ſhall neuer beleeue ſo much as hee ought, nor practiſe the one halfe of that which is required. A great
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19491:59"/>
cauſe of mens diſobedience in religion, is, that they conſult with fleſh and blood, that is, about matters of the ſoul, they conſult with that which is the greateſt enemy to the ſoule. The firſt leſſon to be learned by a Chriſtian is, to <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 16 24.</note>. It ought to ſatisfie thee that God hath ſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo ſpoken, ſo reuealed: whether it be agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or no, it is all one: Say with <hi>Peter, At thy word I will</hi> doe this, or I will beleeue that. Happie is he, who being priuy to his owne ſpirituall blindneſſe, can ſtretch out his hand to the Lord, and ſay with <hi>Dauid, Teach mee, Direct my ſteps in thy word: Let me not wander from thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 119.10.12.133.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Vſe.</note>Thirdly, we are heereby let to ſee what they doe which pleaſe themſelues in their ignorance. What is it, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in their owne miſerie? It is as if a man ſhould content himſelfe to lie in the bottome of a darke ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dungeon, euen when there is meanes offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him. What is the chiefe part of our naturall miſery? Is it not this, that we <hi>ſit in darkneſſe?</hi> But what <hi>darkneſſe</hi> is it? Our ſenſes doe tell vs, it is not any outward, bodily darkeneſſe, which is meant: It cannot bee any, but the <hi>darkeneſſe</hi> of the <hi>ſoule.</hi> And what is the <hi>darkeneſſe</hi> of the <hi>ſoule</hi> but Ignorance and dulneſſe? Faith is the eie of the ſoule, and knowledge the ground of Faith. You then, which wilfully muzzell your ſelues in ignorance, which deſire not to bee better taught, which are wearie of the meanes of knowledge; what doe you, but euen reſolue with your ſelues to lie ſtill in <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and to ruſh your ſelues into that <hi>Vtter darkneſſe,</hi> where nothing will bee beſides <hi>Weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 8.12.</note>. Remember wee then, that as by nature in reſpect of ſinne, wee are of all creatures the moſt miſerable, ſo one branch of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is the darkneſſe of ignorance, the want of true ſauing knowledge: if we doe willingly and contentedly cheriſh our ſelues therein, and refuſe to vnderſtand the things which belong vnto our Peace, it is all one as if we ſhould
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19491:59"/>
ſay, <hi>Wee will not be ſaued; Hell ſhall bee more welcome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs then eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond part of our naturall miſerie, is,<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>The want of true comfort. There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith God</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Iſay 57.21.</note>. The conſcience, naturally, being not yet renued and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Chriſts blood, hath in it, one of theſe two euils; Senſleſneſſe, or Amazedneſſe: Either it is blockiſh and benummed and feeleth nothing, and ſo paſſeth on in a kinde of drowſineſſe and ſecuritie, like an <hi>Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pro. 7.22.</note>; or els it is perplexed and diſtracted with inward horror, not knowing which way to turne it ſelfe for any true refreſhing: And the reaſon is this; In euery naturall heart, Sathan reigneth and <hi>worketh</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 2.2.</note>, and Chriſt is a ſtranger from it. Now where the King of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion reigneth, and where the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iſay 9.6.</note> is a ſtranger, what comfort can bee looked for? Againe, the foundation of all true comfort, is the perſwaſion of Gods loue in the forgiueneſſe of ſins; but this, I am ſure, doth not grow in natures garden. And thirdly, let a ſoule be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a heart pricked, a conſcience aſtoniſhed, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſin, and with <hi>the Terror of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.11.</note>, all the wit, of all the wiſeſt men in the World, out of their owne reaſon cannot comfort it. This is a lim of our natural dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let vs once be touched with inward ſorrow, let na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe her beſt, let carnall reaſon ſtretch it ſelfe to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pin, yet ſhall we be ſwallowed vp with diſmaiednes.</p>
            <p>This teacheth vs, what we muſt doe,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> when as in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, loſſe, diſgraces, and in any other ſadneſſe, and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſſe of ſpirit we deſire refreſhing. If wee aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Nature or of carnall friends, what direction ſhall we receaue? Companie, Muſicke, diſcourſe, gaming, and things of the like nature; which are like to water taken by one ſicke of a burning feuer, which cooleth a little at the firſt, but after encreaſeth the heat: or to ſtickes catched at by a man readie to be drowned, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſome hope of helpe, but yet faile in the vſe, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19491:60"/>
periſh with him that truſted to them. If wee deſire true comfort, we muſt goe out of our ſelues, and looke vpward, to him, who is the <hi>God of all conſolation</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 1.3.</note>. In his word we muſt meditate: <hi>Except</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) thy Law had been my delight, I ſhould now haue periſhed in mine affliction</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Pſ. 119.92.</note>. The cauſe of mens deadneſſe in the day of ſorrow, is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance vpon carnall meanes (<hi>the reed of Egypt</hi>

            <p>Thus much touching the ſtate of the parties, vpon whom Chriſt beſtoweth the benefit of ſaluation: where we ſee what we are all by nature without Chriſt; without the light of knowledge, without the light of comfort, ready to be ſwallowed vp in the darkneſſe of eternall death. The right vnderſtanding of this point, when it workes to the humbling of the ſoule, is the very firſt ſtep to happineſſe, and the firſt fruits of true godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be handled in this Text, is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the benefit, which is heere declared in two things: 1. <hi>To giue light:</hi> 2. <hi>To guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> Of theſe two in their courſe.

Whatſoeuer is vnderſtood by <hi>Darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death;</hi> the contrarie thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is intended by this word <hi>Light:</hi> as namely, <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>knowledge, Light</hi> of comfort, and <hi>Light</hi> of life.<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> All theſe three are meant by the word <hi>Light,</hi> and into the world Chriſt came to impart theſe three.

               <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 9.39.</note>. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, the onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c. hee hath declared him</hi>

To aſſure vs that the Word is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conuey the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> it is ſaid, to <hi>giue Light to the eies</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 19.8.</note>; and the Miniſtrie of it, is called the <hi>Light of the World</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 5.14.</note>; the Miniſters themſelues, are ſaid to bee <hi>Starres in Chriſts right hand</hi>

               <note n="k" place="margin">Luc. 1.77.</note>. Againe, that we may know the Word to be the Inſtrument of comfort, it is ſaid to <hi>reioice the Heart</hi>

               <note n="m" place="margin">Pſa. 119.50.</note>. Thirdly, to certifie vs, that it is the Inſtrument of Life, it is called the <hi>Word of Life</hi>

               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſa. 119.93.</note>. Touching the <hi>Spirit,</hi> aſmuch is teſtified alſo. By it God giues Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is <hi>the Spirit of Truth, and leadeth into truth</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note>. The worke thereof is called <hi>the opening of the Heart</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Act. 16.14.</note>, and the <hi>opening of the vnderſtanding</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Luc. 24.45.</note>. Secondly, by it commeth Comfort; therefore he is called <hi>the Comforter</hi>

               <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note>. Thus we ſee, Chriſt the <hi>Day-ſpring,</hi> for what end he came, euen to <hi>giue Light,</hi> namely, the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the Light of comfort, and the Light of Life: We vnderſtand alſo, how he ſendeth foorth theſe his beames vpon vs: Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the brightneſſe of his Word: Inwardly, by the ſhining of his Spirit.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>The firſt vſe is, to make the tidings of the Goſpel, to be (as in their owne nature they are) <hi>tidings vnto vs of great ioy</hi>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19491:61"/>
why ſo? The ſubſtance of the Goſpell is Chriſt Ieſus, and the ſumme of his office is to <hi>giue Light:</hi> What one thing is there in the world more comfortable? When <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt were in danger of ſhipwracke, <hi>they wiſhed</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>that the day were come</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Act. 27.29.</note>. The darkneſſe of the night added to their danger, and doubled their feare: Euerie houre ſeemed two, vntill the day were broken. Indeed that ſaying is true of euill doers: <hi>The morning is to them as the ſhadow of the death</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iob 24.17.</note>: but to them of honeſt cariage, the light of the day is exceeding welcome. Therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſetteth foorth his longing after God, by the <hi>watching of the morning watch for the morning</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 130.6.</note>. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> that hee <hi>reioyced to ſee Chriſts day</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 8.56.</note>: A little glimpſe of this light was the very ioy of <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart. How great therefore and intolerable is our dulneſſe, who take. no contentment in the beames of this <hi>Light,</hi> which ſhine vnto vs? A great bleſſing it is, which is reported of <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthalim; The people which ſate in darkneſſe ſaw great Light, and to them which ſate in the Region and ſhadow of death light is riſen vp</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Matt. 4.16.</note>. Wee (by the goodneſſe of God) enioy the like bleſſing, and yet, in the opinion of the moſt, it is nothing leſſe than a bleſſing: Men had rather lie wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the darkneſſe of Ignorance, than open their eies to receiue that light which is offred vnto them by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. This is that which will bring hell and iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this generation, according to that ſpeech of Chriſt: <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and men loue darkneſſe rather than light</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 3.19.</note>. A maruell it is, that men ſhould reiect ſuch a bleſſing: But Chriſt hath told the reaſon; It is, <hi>becauſe their deeds are euill.</hi> This Light of doctrine diſcouereth their ſinnes, (for it is <hi>Light which maketh all things manifeſt</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 5.13.</note>) it bewrayeth the groſſeneſſe of their courſes, and layeth open many a mans hypocriſie, who ſeemed to himſelfe, and was reputed by others, to be ſuch an one as he ought to be. There cannot be a greater vexation to men of corrupt mindes than to be met with in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19491:62"/>
their ſinnes; they cry then with <hi>Ahab, Hast thou found me, O mine enemie</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">1. Kin. 21.20.</note>? This is the cauſe that the Light of grace, which wee ought of all other things moſt to reioice in, is become ſuch a burthen vnto vs; it diſcouereth that, which we deſire by all meanes to keepe cloſe. <hi>The world hates me</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 7.7.</note>. Remember we therefore: Chriſt is the Light, we are they to whom he offreth Light; he hath ſent his word to enlighten vs. If wee reioice not in this Light, but wiſh rather it were euen blowne out, that wee might ſleepe freely in our ſinnes, it ſheweth vs to be the heires of darkneſſe, and that the ſhadow of eternall death muſt bee our portion.</p>

               <note n="i" place="margin">Mic. 3.6.</note> Our vnthankfulneſſe and barrenneſſe in our profeſſion, our lothing of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Mannah,</hi> hath deſerued this, and more: It is holie wiſedome therefore for vs, to take the benefit of the light whiles it yet ſhineth, leſt ſuch a iudgement ſhould come vpon vs, as Chriſt ſpake of; namely, that we ſhould <hi>deſire to ſee one of the daies, which we now</hi> ſee and value not, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <note n="k" place="margin">Luc. 17.22.</note>. Perhaps, in the opinion of ſome this is no iudgement, nay it is the very thing they deſire, being like thoſe, who when the Prophets of God were ſlaine, <hi>reioiced ouer them, and ſent gifts one to another</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Reu. 11.10.</note>. But let them heare what Chriſt ſaith; <hi>He that walketh in the darke, knoweth not whither he goeth</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19491:62"/>
without the Light of doctrine: They goe, they know not whither; they beleeue, they know not what; downe they will be in the pit before they are aware. But (wil ſome ſay) will you make vs ſo blinde and ſo ſimple, that wee cannot ſee the way to heauen without you? I anſwer with the words of Chriſt to the Phariſies; <hi>Now yee ſay, we ſee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſinne remaineth</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 9.41.</note>: You which thinke your ſelues ſo cunning, there is none ſo blinde, no bodies caſe is more deſperate.</p>

               <hi>Walke as the children of Light</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 5.8.</note>: That is, Chriſt is come into the world to enlighten, his word is preached, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey the light of grace into our harts: this is no ſmal priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; behaue your ſelues therefore agreeably to this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, liue as becommeth thoſe whom God hath called into Light. This ſame thing the ſame Apoſtle vrgeth elſewhere: <hi>The night is paſt</hi> (the time of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is blown ouer) <hi>the day is come</hi> (the Light of grace &amp; knowledge hath appeared) <hi>put on therefore the armour of Light</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 13.12.</note>. Wee may thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it: Men that by occaſion goe abroad in the night, are not ſo curious about their attire, thinking that whatſoeuer is amiſſe, will bee ſhrouded vnder the mantle of the night: But he who goeth foorth at noone day, will be more carefull, that nothing may bee ſeene contrarie to modeſtie, contrarie to ciuilitie: So (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the daies of your ignorance, happily you might doe ſuch or ſuch things, and becauſe you knew no other, they might (in ſome ſort) be borne withall: but now the caſe is otherwiſe: Light hath ſhined, grace hath appeared, knowledge is preached vnto you, therefore other things are now expected; if you now liue as in times paſt, your fact cannot be hid, your fault cannot be excuſed: We ſee in generall, what the Apoſtle perſwades: That we may more fully conceiue what this is to <hi>Walke in the Light;</hi> let vs heare him opening the ſame vnto vs: It comprehends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it three things: 1. To <hi>approoue that which is pleaſing to

the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 5.10.</note>, which is reuealed in the Scripture, and is more and more made knowen vnto vs by Preaching. 2. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>the vnfruitfull works of darkneſſe</hi>

               <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 5.4.</note>. 3. To <hi>Reprooue them:</hi> that is, to carie our ſelues in that holy and blameleſſe maner, that our verie liues, (though we hold our tongues) may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lay open and condemne the leaud faſhions of the vngodly. This is <hi>to walke as the children of Light.</hi> This is ſtraitly required of thoſe which enioy the Light, but (alas) full ſlightly it is performed. How common, how ſhameleſſe, and how preſumptuous are theſe vnfruitfull works of darkneſſe; ſecuritie, contempt of goodneſſe, ſcorne of Religion; Pride, Whoredome and ſuch like? do theſe agree with that Light which God hath giuen vs? Thinke we that God hath a part in vs, when theſe things beare dominion ouer vs? It is vnpoſſible. <hi>If we ſay we haue fellowſhip with God, and walke in darkeneſſe, we lie, and do not truely</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.6.</note>. The concluſion is this; Chriſt is our Light, hee imparteth his beames vnto vs by his Word: If we loue this Light, let vs <hi>walke as the children of Light.</hi> The works of darkneſſe will bring vs into his power who is the Prince of darkneſſe, we cannot eſcape it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the Benefit, is, <hi>To guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> Heere it muſt firſt be enquired what is <hi>the way of peace.</hi> Secondly, it muſt be prooued that we need a Guide. Thirdly, it muſt bee iuſtified that Chriſt is the Guide. Laſtly, it muſt be ſhewed, how he doth guide. Of theſe briefly.</p>

            <p>We ſee by this, how ſoulely wee doe all erre by nature,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Vſe.</note> how apt we be ſtill in matters which concerne our ſoules to be miſtaken, how graciouſly God hath dealt with vs in prouiding vs a Guide; What ſhould we now learne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but this? In all thankfulneſſe and humilitie to yeeld our ſelues vnto his conduct. Hee hath <hi>prepared for vs a way by his bloud</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 10.20.</note>, hee hath troden out a path by his <hi>owne Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 13.15.</note>, hee hath left vs his Word and the Miniſtrie thereof, to point out the finger to the right way, and <hi>to ſhew vs what is good</hi>

               <note n="o" place="margin">Iſay 5.4.</note>? Shall wee now when all things are thus fitted for vs, bee like thoſe ſpoken of in the Prophet, who when the way was laid out before them, ſaid plainly, <hi>We will not walke therein</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 6.16.</note>? God forbid. And indeed, we our ſelues if we doe conſider it, muſt needs condemne it, that it ſhould be ſo. Why then is it ſo? Chriſt calleth daily vpon vs in his word, while we be trauelling in our owne waies; <hi>Returne yee ſonnes of Adam</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 90.3.</note>. <hi>Why will yee die, O houſe of Iſrael? Cauſe therefore one another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>

to goe the cleane contrarie. If it were asked of vs, whether we would refuſe to follow Chriſt, wee would all ſay with one voice, <hi>God forbid we ſhould refuſe it:</hi> but when hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth his directions to vs in his Word, we will not follow them. Hold wee this then: Chriſt is the head Guide: His Word and the preaching thereof is the ſtaffe and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conduct vs: if wee refuſe that guidance, wee ſhall neuer finde the way which leadeth vnto peace.</p>
